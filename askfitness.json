I\u2019m not one of those people. If I stop I\u2019ll fall off, so I need to put something in even if it\u2019s not totally accurate. \n\nOne other thing to be mindful of, restaurants also add tons of salt.

Usually everything else is pretty reasaonble to guess as you've noted. \n\nI make an upper end guess of what I think the oil/butters in the dish would be -- for something like salmon with potatoes and veggies, at most brunch places I might guess that comes with 3-4 tbsp of oil/butter? That's probably an overestimate. One thing I try to avoid is soups, because it's so hard to tell how much cream there is sometimes... \n\nYou can also post to r/caloriecount if you want to outsource the work of making the guess.",

ChatGPT will do it's best to estimate macros and calories for you.\n\n  \nHowever, it varies so damn much with how drastic the caloric counts vary across restaurants (For example, compare the calories on a pasta dish at Olive Garden to a pasta dish from The Cheesecake Factory). I've given up on tracking at restaurants. It's also a big reason why I've almost completely eliminated restaurant eating from my life. It's been great on the bank account, and great on the waistline.

Although I didn't think of it too much at the time in retrospect my dermatologist and hair stylist said the short period of hair loss (I'm ok now and scalp is healthy) was likely due to hormonal changes from my weight loss (even though it wasn't super fast I might have gone a bit too low with my weight for my height). I actually liked being at 139lbs because I could run super fast but in retrospect I quickly realised back then my head & body looked a little out of proportion (body too skinny) so I gained some weight back. I'm 45 years old, 152lbs with 14% body fat now so much more muscular than those 139 lbs days.Goodl luck.",

Most metric like this, have a variance. And you may just not fit the standard model. It doesn't necessry mean you are less healthy.\n\nAlso, the place where you measure the waist can result in big differences. If I remember properly, the WTHR is mostly used with a mid waist measurement (half way between the lowest rib and the top of the iliac crest bone). Where for many people the waist is the smallest. If you measure lower (top of the iliac crest bone), like many people do for the US Navy formula to estimate BF%, you will get a much bigger circumference.\n\nFor WTHR, I would use the smallest waist you can measure.\n\nIn your place I would also look at alternatives metrics to see what they give. You have a very good BMI, a slightly less optimal WTHR. What would be the BF%, as measured with a caliper? A caliper is cheap and provides a decent  measurement of total BF%. Subcutaneous fat, has a very good correlation between it and visceral fat so this will still be interesting.

Just be sure you ditch the alcohol because it truly doesn't help in any way whatsoever (not saying you have to go teetotal, don't get me wrong! lol).",

I appreciate you bringing that up because I really don\u2019t even consider it. I\u2019m still in weight-loss mode but it really is the prime time to start lifting and building muscle. Thank you again, and good luck to you as well!",

Seeing results definitely makes you want to continue, and knowing that you're helping and healing yourself every day you keep up with it is also such an encouragement. Best of luck to you, as well!",
                "Thank you so much! I've kind of given up on O.M.A.D. because I really, REALLY enjoy my morning coffee with creamer. And I'm a perfectionist when it comes to fasting. For me, a single calorie ends my fasting. A lot of people do dirty fasting, and that is totally fine because it also works! For me, though, I was rigid. Because of that, I do a lot of 16/8 nowadays. In the end though, fasting is just a tool to limit your calories. It's all calories in/calories out (in my opinion!).",
                "Hey there, thank you! I'm 5'9\". I will admit, my weight loss was pretty swift but I think that's just due to being really disciplined with it. I wanted to lose the weight and I made it my one and only mission in life basically, lol. I stuck to mainly raw and really basic foods (eggs, cottage cheese, veggies, etc.), never used any oil in my cooking, stuff like that. I don't know if that truly matters, lol, but just saying. You've only got 35 more to go and I know you'll kill it soon enough. For real, in a few months you'll look back on your comment when you're at your goal weight and think, \"Dang, that went by quickly!\" Good luck!!",
                "Honestly, the hardest part is just DOING IT. But once you start and stick with it for a little bit, it just gets easier by the day. Now, IF isn't a necessity to lose weight, but for me, it helped by limiting the timeframe for when I can eat. But you have to be really disciplined and no cheating! If you want to do something easier to start out, I recommend 16/8 fasting. Skipping breakfast is the easiest way, in my opinion. So, wake up in the morning, have some black coffee or tea (no sugar or cream/milk) if you need it, but mostly just fill yourself with water. You can eat lunch and then dinner normally (obviously eat healthy and track your calories), but the second you swallow that last morsel, start the fasting tracker clock and STICK WITH IT! You've got this!!",

When I let go of the focus on restriction and started thinking of it in terms of just working on self-care practices, including feeding myself in ways that made me feel better, I'm finding that the metabolic dysfunction is correcting itself.

Not the best two \"founders\", if you ask me.  \nTo this day, I am not sure why real health organisations are so obsessed with it. Yes, it's a quick check in which weight category you fall, but quite honestly, it's entirely useless with other metrics. Bodybuilders are heavily obese according to BMI as it doesn't not take fat vs. muscles into account. A lot of active \"pre-obese\" people are very healthy, and some thin people who barely fall into the normal category absolutelyshouldngain a bit to be more healthy...

Your selfesteem is clearly super low at the moment - a therapist is exactly the right person to talk this through with!\nThe problem is, somehow the world is suggesting to us that just by losing weight, all our problems will go away. What I've learned is that mental health comes first - once that's on the right track, you'll have an easier time losing and maintaining a lower weight as well.\n\n3. Relationships are a true miracle. This is true for everyone, not just overweight people. To find someone you fall in love with, and then for them to fall inlove with you as well, that's rare! And in all honesty, great relationships are not built on looks. It's personality - being able to truly love someone in not just thoughts, but words and actions. I get the insecurity of not being loved back by people you have a crush on - but crushed come and go (they really do!). To find someone who you truly click with, you either have to go out and meet lots of people at first - or you might get lucky randomly. Either way, I wouldn't expect it.

Sometimes those realizations include that you would benefit from therapy and/or medication. Not always.\n\nHealthy, sustainable weight loss requires more than cico. It's not as simple as people lead you to believe. It isn't just a numbers game.

But, holy fucking shit balls he was so mean to himself that it poisoned the relationship. We\u2019d probably still be together if he had just lightened up on the self loathing. But I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Every single day was about how horrible he was and how he questioned my judgment for being with him. It was emotionally exhausting.

He\u2019s not the type of guy you\u2019d want to spend loads of time with. \n\nI\u2019d challenge you to run a thought experiment about what life would actually be like if you were that hot. It\u2019s not all it\u2019s cracked up to be. If you want a real relationship, you\u2019ll see her at her worst, and she will see the same.

Up til that point I didn\u2019t think I looked any different. \n\nGood luck bud, I\u2019m sorry your path seems more challenging than your brothers, I hope you can get the support you need and get what you want out of life.",
                "I\u2019m so sorry you aren\u2019t feeling well, if nothing has changed in the dating world since losing weight, that was probably never your problem. I would recommend looking at your communication style and behavior in general; those are two big factors in finding a mate.",
                "No one is guaranteed to have a girlfriend just because they lost weight. Even if you had the body of a male bodybuilder, you are not guaranteed a girlfriend. Lack of confidence and your attitude is probably the reason why you are struggling with the ladies.",
                "Please grow up. I'm a woman and losing weight greatly improved my looks. Guess what? Men still aren't obligated to date me and there won't be a Mr. Perfect or a Mr. Right guaranteed now or even after i reach my goal weight, learned to doll up and dressing well. If men aren't interested in me, well it really sucks but that's how it is unfortunately. You can't force interest and attention when it comes to love \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nLooks is a part of attraction, but it's not the be all end all. You're frustrated and i understand, i sometimes really wish i have someone else's traits and achievements, too. So I'm working on the aspects that i can improve with hard work, and let the others (luck, natural talents, etc) go because what's the point? I mean, i can point out things in the post that you do well for yourself, but you will look down at yourself anyway. Think about it this way, do you like dealing with and perpetually having to cheer someone with very low self esteem up everyday?",
                "Unfortunately, there\u2019s not a 1:1 correlation between your outside appearance changing and your inside feeling changing. Those can be two totally independent things. \n\nFocus on what\u2019s logically true: \n\n1. it was necessary to lose weight for health reasons, whether ones that you experience now, or to prevent future issues (that\u2019s the really important one)\n\n2. Achieving that takes a lot of discipline and you did it! That\u2019s a good thing.\n\n3. Your brain is still catching up to the new normal of your weight loss. There are internal processes you can\u2019t see but know exist.\n\n4. Attractive, healthy weight people also get ghosted, meet shitty people, get rejected etc. It\u2019s not a magic wand that removes the shittiness of people. You are simply participating in the human experience.\n\n5. You may be overly fixated on your brothers ease/ have understandable unresolved trauma and that\u2019s probably an area to work on with your therapist. \n\nYou\u2019re doing great, be proud of yourself!",
                "I'm in the exact same boat my dude - got to my goal weight and I was still not happy. Ho boy, this hit home hard. \n\nFrom personal experience, basing your weight loss on an appearance-centred goal is not often ideal. However, if you're really dead set on it, talk to your therapist about trying to set a realistic goal. DO NOT, do it for validation. It's really not great for the mental health. \n\nAlso, If you're feeling weaker, cut the deficit for a while and focus on building muscle while eating a little more (high protein while at maintenance, or maybe a little over). Once you're feeling stronger, start another gentle deficit with a lot of protein, and keep up the weights. It is by far the best method for fat loss. I know it''s criminal how long muscle takes to build, but it takes patience and a good high protein diet!\n\nLastly, you look great and it's quite a big change, even if you can't see it yourself. I mean, I wouldn't turn you away.\n\n*Edited, as my dump arse didn't read the whole post. \ud83d\ude44",

I'd suggest to keep going to therapy, it sounds like you could benefit from working on inner stuff like self confidence, self esteem, and self compassion. You did awesome work with your weight loss but mental issues don't disappear with the weight, the mental stuff needs work just like the body does. When people ghost you, keep in mind this is telling of them - not of you. People not treating you right doesn't mean that you're not desirable, it simply means that they're assholes. Try to hang in there and work on self compassion and kindness to yourself. The best advice I've ever been given is to be for myself what I'm looking for in others; validation has to come from within, if you look for it in others you will keep on feeling not good and be disappointed. Easier said than done but this can be practiced in therapy and every day life situations and the more you do it the more natural it becomes and you will feel in a better state of mind.",
                "You are not alone.\n\nLosing the weight fixes your body and makes you healthier. But it doesn\u2019t take away the years of being made fun of, being invisible, and feeling rejected.\n\nOnce you stop attributing your self-worth to something other than your weight and how you look, new doors will open up. And then it won\u2019t even matter.\n\nGaining and losing weight is a bodily function. Nothing more. Managing your weight is no different than hygiene: it is only one small part of the act of taking care of yourself, loving your body, and building confidence and self-worth.\n\nI don\u2019t know what it is, but people around you can sense when you are improving yourself and building your confidence. It inspires and makes them look up to you, which makes them want to be around you. This increases the odds of meeting a significant other which, by the way, isn\u2019t some grand prize for losing weight. You have to go through the steps like everyone else.\n\nIn short, if you don\u2019t love yourself, women probably won\u2019t either. Nothing is for free.\n\nKeep doing the work with therapy and start repairing those years of damage.

You don\u2019t believe you\u2019re wanted, you hate yourself, probably scowl a lot\u2026 yeah girls aren\u2019t going to want to be around that attitude. Work on making your \u201cneutral\u201d face into a \u201cneutral positive\u201d one. Relax your face muscles. Let there be a little smile on your lips. Don\u2019t furrow your brow.

You can be the best friend, the parent who was a shitty parent, hell you can be your own girlfriend!

Give it several months for you to find new clothes that suit you.\n- get a new wardrobe! Potentially get help by hiring a stylist. Style goes a REALLY long way.\n- get some hobbies that build your confidence! Dancing, boxing, music, etc. find something that makes you feel badass.

                "Took me a while to process what you said. A few things came to mind - please forgive my inferences based on a short statement and disregard anything below that makes no sense.\n\n1. You might be having a low grade depression for a while already - despite of being able to stick to weight loss work. Seeing a paramedic job as a lowly job is disrespecting and putting down all those who come into stressful and charged situations, get mistreated daily, often work in highly unsanitary and/or hazardous conditions with baseline sane or even insane people. And even sadder is that you put down yourself and your colleagues. Most people admire paramedics, trust them and rely on them for help in desperate times. I don't see anything else other than depression here that would explain your attitude to your work - not depressed people look and find another job and quit, or go to school for something else. \n\n2. You seem to be grieving the lost time and female attention that your brother and others had (as you imagine it because 80% of what men are bragging about are just white lies and wishful thinking) Attention and interest definitely boosts one's ego but they are fleeting and ultimately very tiring because you can't accept all advances, so some would have to be turned down (and some women don't give up easily), some regretted, some immediately forgotten, some develop further - and all need work from your side too, one way or another. Check blogs of guys who honestly tell you how suffocated they feel with women throwing themselves at the guy when all that matters is that only women the guy himself want show attention. \n\n3. You seem to be confused what you want. If you want a woman to share your life with, achieve goals, make home and have children with, you need ONE woman (at a time, not extrapolating into poly, ENM and so forth). If that's what you want, women throwing themselves at you is incompatible with this goal because nobody has all that time, energy and money to explore the above with all of them. And more importantly, the woman has to want and be capable of all that future you envy. How do you imagine all women throwing themselves at you sharing that vision of yours. So you gotta work with your therapist and decide whether you allocate the next three years as either a) playboy years and go for it, b) create conditiond and search for a throphy wife, c) clearly figure out what your attachment style is and work to move towards a secure one, figure out what are your sexual proficiencies and expectations and how reasonable they are, get clear who you want, who is compatible, who is not compatible, what a happy couple means to you, etc. Once you do figure all that out, you will see that woman among those you meet on your way. They are around you, you just have a confused navigation system. \n\n4. You seem to completely exclude the desires and inclinations of that woman who triggered your weight loss. No matter how much you just for her, it doesn't mean that she has to and does just for you. Maybe start with getting to know her as a person? You will either want her more, or will discover that you were in a fantasy world...\n\n5. You don't know about the daily ups and downs of your brothers family life. It is never always sunny in every relationship, certainly they have there own difficulties. \n\nI could go on and on and on and come up with at least another dozen of points - been there myself. I have several male friends with whom I won't have sex ever - not on principle but rather I simply don't want them while my gfs find them very attractive. And same for the guys - we chatted about their obsessions with other women and clarified the position between us, so I am comfortable to make such statements. \nKeep reminding yourself that sex, friendships and relationships are a two way street and the status quo changes in continuum. \nWishing you all the happiness and contentment in the world!",

And somehow, the people who talk about being \"touch starved\" never seem to think that platonic touch from people they aren't attracted to counts, which is like saying you're starving because you didn't eat a cheeseburger and fries, even though you consumed adequate calories in broccoli and salmon. \n\nIt's a term used mostly by people who want to feel sorry for themselves and make other people responsible for their feelings.",

There is nothing you can eat or do that will make you not eligible for starting to lose weight the next day.\n\nOne of the biggest problems is people focusing on the guilt feeling when you should be focusing on trying to figure out how to get back on track and be more successful with your project.\n\nAnother mistake is people demand immediate, fast results and get discouraged when they don't see those results. Losing weight can be quite fast, (I lost 90lbs in 9 months) but more realistically you need to prepare yourself for a long campaign. A marathon rather than sprint. And what this means is focusing on sustainability. Your ability to stick to the process long term is more important than any quick results.\n\n>\u00a0I've lost 20lbs in about a month and a half, but this past week has been so difficult to keep going.\n\nWhile a lot of lost weight when starting can be attributed to just water, I would suggest this is probably still a very fast weight loss. Probably too fast. There is multiple reasons why you may want to slow down:\n\n\\* You will be losing a ton of muscle along with the fat which is not great. You need that muscle later to burn more fat. Most of the energy that you expend is through muscles. The more muscle you have, the easier it is for you to move around and keep burning more calories. While you burn pretty much the same amount of calories regardless of how much muscle you have, with less muscles those muscles are more loaded and tire more quickly which will cut into your ability to do exercise and recover from them.\n\n\\* You may develop deficiencies and hormonal imbalances. A very low calorie diet gives you little options to deliver important nutrients. You still need to deliver same nutrients regardless of the caloric content of your diet, but if you cut your diet in half you need to make your diet about twice as dense in important nutrients.\n\n\\* The intense feelings of hunger can make you irritable, tired and prone to binge eating. I believe it is better to slow down but offer less chances for breaking your diet.\n\nAnyway, congrats on starting the journey.\n\nRemember, the only way to lose at weight loss is to quit.\n\nI love talking with people over zoom so if you want you can reach out to me and we can have a chat.",

I can tell you this from experience as a long-time distance runner.\n\nIf anything, losing weight will reduce the incidence of lower body injuries because you're fundamentally carrying less weight and hence are putting less strain on your joints.

The third would be your center of balance can change and you body needs to learn how to move differently with burdens on other muscles and less fat improves range.

The pain might stem from fatigue based on this slower recovery but you also mentioned you\u2019ve dropped the weights during the cut. \n\nMy hunch is that the lower body pain could stem from overuse, mainly because both squats/deadlifts and basketball require explosive power due to the amount of springiness and jumping required in the sport. Even as a runner, where it\u2019s less muscular and much more tendon/joint based, I leave a day either side of leg training just to minimise impact on recovery. \n\nBack pain could be due to a form issue such as arching your back when deadlifting or squatting.

I weightlift 3x a week and figured out my maintenance calories to be about 1800cal. \nIf I cut my calorie intake to about 1600 and NOT work out, I can lose weight and see so on the scale, but the second I go weightlift, my weight jumps back up to 180 and I can\u2019t get it to move. \nFor instance, last week I was sick and didn\u2019t get to go to the gym or get my steps in at all, but I stayed with my caloric deficit and weighed in at 177 at the end of the week. A few months ago, I skipped the gym for several weeks and saw a steady drop of about 1-1.5lbs each week and I hit 172lbs\u2026until I went back to the gym. \nThis Monday, I went for a 45 min lift and have weighed in at 180.6 every day since then.\nShould I stop lifting for a bit? (I want muscle tone, I don\u2019t want to lose weight and just be skinny lol) should I just go for walks? Am I missing something here? ",

                "> but the second I go weightlift, my weight jumps back up to 180 and I can\u2019t get it to move.\n\nThis is muscle inflammation (water stiffening the muscle so it can start to build/repair from the session).   \n\n> Should I stop lifting for a bit?\n\nNo, but get to Week 7 and then notice that your muscles are more conditioned to the work and your fat losses are beginning to outstrip these inflammations, and the scale is going down.  \n\nStarting or increasing a weight-lifting routine can cause your weight to plateau or increase.  Don't worry, it's okay, you are probably still losing fat at a good rate!  Inflammation caused by weightlifting temporarily slows your *weight loss* but not your *fat loss*. \n\nWhen we start or intensify lifting, we're creating micro-sized tears in our muscles.  Muscles swell (water) and become inflamed (water) during a muscle-repair process that takes several days.  This additional water added offsets our fat loss.  BF% still going down but Water% going up can cause the weight-loser's total scale weight to slow, stall, or even temporarily go higher.  \n\nKeep lifting.  The water weight from lifting can take 3-5 weeks to calm down.  After that, the added water weight still happens at smaller amounts because the lifter's muscles become accustomed to the workloads and the amount of inflammation is reduced.  By then the weight-losers fat loss has outpaced the water weight remaining and the scale graph is back to its normal downward slope.",

                ">  I feel like giving up.\n\nGiving up is the worst.  You saw what happened when you temporarily gave up in Feb/March.    Two things we have to always be doing:  persistence and resistance.    We can take a restorative and refreshing maintenance break, but even that is actively doing things to avoid a lack of vigilance and to avoid overeating.  \n\nWe live in a world that, if we stop paying attention, we'll gain... and gain... and gain.   The marketers know how to push our buttons to make them rich (and us too heavy).   It takes, not a consistency, but a constancy of attention: a non-zero effort just to keep our weight reasonably steady.  \n\n> My trainer says maybe it's because my body got used to the healthy eating and exercise so I have to try even harder but I'm already trying so much. I just don't know what else I can do.\n\nOK, let's unpack \"the healthy eating and exercise.\"\n\nThere is a clearer way to think about fitness and fatness, and I\u2019d like to share it with you:\n\n- Physical activity mainly affects our fitness, not our fatness.\n- Food intake mainly affects our fatness, not our fitness.\n\nUnderstanding these as two separate issues with different solutions helps us address our health needs more effectively. Having a healthy weight and being fit are both important, but \"diet and exercise\" are not one thing\u2014they are two different things.\n\nThere is a small overlap between these areas. For example, exercise burns calories but also increases hunger. \n\nIn other words:\n\n- You can't get stronger by dieting alone; physical activity is necessary. Sitting still doesn\u2019t build strength.\n- You can\u2019t out-exercise a bad diet. Weight problems are caused by overeating, and it's easy to eat too much in today\u2019s world.\n\nWhile we often combine these ideas for overall health, and do them both each week, it\u2019s helpful to see them as more separate than linked. You might adjust your diet for fitness goals or balance losing fat with building muscle, but at their core, they are distinct areas.\n\nCoordinating them wisely and effectively is good, but thinking of them as separate helps match problems to solutions.\n\nI offer to you that weight problems are to always be treated as food problems.   Fitness problems (endurance, strength, balance, agility, speed) are always to be treated as physical activity problems.   Break apart  \"the healthy eating and exercise\" into these two things.\n\n> my body got used to the healthy eating\n\nEvery 10-15 weeks of deficit, for a 7-14 days, eat at maintenance calories instead of at a deficit.   Do all of your normal routine -- staying active, tracking your weight and food, making wise choices, but at maintenance calories.  \n\nMost things in nature thrive not on constant strain, but on tension and release.  Human bodies seem to be no exception.  \n\nTwo articles that describe how and why:\n\n* https://www.gettfit.com/diet-breaks-for-fat-loss/\n* https://bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/the-full-diet-break\n\nA good time for this is when it is convenient -- travel, major holidays, being visited by the relatives.   It's nice to have more calories to spend when things like that happen, and it's also good for keeping our metabolism higher.  It's not permission for a blow out -- we do all of our disciplines, just with maintenance-level calories as a target.\n\n> my body got used to the [...] exercise\n\nYes.  Our skills and our bodies both become efficient, adaptive, and even compensatory during and following repeated physical activities. You do the session itself easier (efficiency), and other parts of your body will start to sense the sessions ramping up and donate energy to it (adaptive), and after your sessions you'll feel less wiped out (compensatory). For these reasons, the 3rd session ultimately burns more than the 30th one, and the 30th one more than the 300th one -- even if your weight wasn't changing at all.    \n\nThis is the main reason why calorie counters start to discount the calorie value of exercise -- at first counting all of it, then half of it, then even less (or none of it).  \n\nIt's my favorite arrangement to create a moderate deficit based on Sedentary TDEE, then let moderate exercise be \"bonus\" to weight loss (without eating calories back, since it is moderate).   In that way, it's \"goof proof.\"  Your Sedentary TDEE is the same as \"pre-exercise TDEE\" and the actual value of the exercise doesn't matter -- it's surely \"more\" but it's anybody's guess how much more depending on how well conditioned we are to the tasks.",

But the lower limit makes sure you don't lose too fast, and you don't get too hungry the next days. Some days, 2000kcal. We all have 2000kcal days. The upper is there to make sure we lose something. Always.\n\nAlso, avoiding an inflexible limit, makes developing binge eating less likely.\n\nThe range should not be too big. You don't want big jumps from day to day, for many reasons, or you may find it harder to hold a good average.\n\n> less active days\n\nActivity and calories are an interesting thing. \n\nMost studies show, that the result of \"acute exercise\", like going for a run, is a decrease in appetite.

I have to kick myself to eat after 10k or longer. But this is effect is temporary (a couple hours).\n\nOn the other side, \"chronic exercise\", like going lifting/running regularly is known to elevate the average appetite.

Your body is meant to be developing and that just makes things complicated. Becoming more active and eating better are great steps though. Even if they don't specifically get your weight moving they will help with your general health and fitness, and give you a better foundation to build on later.",

This caused me to stop growing too early (at age 13), thus not reaching my original projected height of 5\u20196\u201d (which is pretty solid height for a woman in the West) because I had less time to grow to that potential.\n\nBecause I\u2019m short, I have to spend to rest of my life eating like a bird (despite really loving food) just to not gain weight.  Being short also makes it hard to find clothes that properly fit me and look good on me.  I also look weird next to my Western peers because I look so short and stout compared to them.  I\u2019m at least average height in my country of origin (in Southeast Asia), but they still tease me for being too chubby because I\u2019m over 50 kg\u2014my female peers in my country of origin are around my height, but they weigh like 45 to 48 kg (99 lbs to almost 106 lbs).  I don\u2019t fit in anywhere.  Also, I have to be like under 50 kg (110 lbs) to look good and proportionate because I look dumpy if I go over that.\n\nHitting puberty too early also caused me to be at a higher risk for: breast cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, and Type II diabetes (plus family history of T2D).  One of the reasons I\u2019m trying to get skinny is to offset my health risks for these health issues.\n\nMy advice for you would be to focus on the future.

                "Weight lifting is great, but it's not going to create weight loss if you are eating at a surplus. Cardio is going to help you burn more calories in the moment. And calorie counting isn't the only way to restrict intake, but some amount of restriction and moderation is typically necessary to facilitate weight loss.",
                "A reason that we eat different foods as we go through the week is for our nutritional diversity (we need over 3-dozen different nutrients that we get out of the food we eat all week).   Or, said differently, the risk of a narrow diet is nutritional gaps and deficiencies.     These nutrients are what makes our body run well, and a well-running body is what gives it a high metabolism.   \n\nSo, long answer, for -- you'd better vary your food reasonably well.  Many people eat one meal the same each day, or have a go-to snack, but have different items for lunch and dinner.   However you arrange it, that's what to keep in mind.\n\nTry small portions... lunch for me can be a bowl of soup and a half-sandwich, or a mug of soup and a whole sandwich.  But it's too many calories for a whole sandwich and a whole bowl of soup.  (And I'm maintaining, not on a deficit.)   It's surprising how little we should eat, but the calorie numbers are the proof.\n\n> Also is it possible to lose weight just by weight lifting?\n\nNo, not really.

Getting back into your routine after a long break can be super challenging, especially when you're dealing with so much. It might help to start small, like just adding one healthy meal or short walk into your day and slowly build from there. It\u2019s totally okay to ease into it; even small steps can lead to big changes. Changing things up a bit might help too, sometimes a fresh approach can make things feel less daunting. Just take it one step at a time, and be kind to yourself."

It helps me to pay attention to the little things like snacks or the excess of condiments in meal preparation. It is amazing how sometimes a snack whose caloric intake is underestimated can provide the same calories as a main meal, completely ruining the efforts made during the rest of the day.\n\nI am also keeping track of the amount of water I drink during the day, as I have a bad habit of drinking very little. I set my minimum at 2 litres a day, although I try to stay preferably around 3. \n\nMy only doubt is about my daily calorie target. My app (Yazio) suggests, after a long list of questions about my parameters, habits and goals, a daily target of around 2700 calories (already calculating the deficit) but this seems like a lot and I usually try to stay under 2000, as I don't even do sports or training activities.\n\nThank you again for this weekly space.

Poured it over the tofu and left it for about 15 mins while making everything else. Ate it with rice, carrot and courgette mandolined into ribbons :) and topped with some sesame seeds and Japanese rice topping mix ( can't remember what its called but basically more sesame seeds with seaweed and wasabi flavouring I think ahaha ) super yum!\n\nOtherwise for firm tofu I do a similar kind of marinade (although probably doubling the amount liquid) and leave it for 20-30 mins, then remove it from tbe marinade and either bake it in the oven or fry in the pan ! I think you get more flavour when frying it but baking is also fine and uses less oil. Probably the most important thing is to eat it with plenty of the leftover marinade (mainly soy sauce seasoned with rice vinegar and sesame oil, sometimes I add a bit of miso paste and/or honey) because as you say, the tofu doesn t have any real flavour to begin with aha \n\nHope that helps ! :)",

In later weeks, use the data to figure out if any foods need to be adjusted. All foods can fit, but sometimes we have to juggle or learn a new way to make an old favorite.\n\nThe apps in that guide will do the counting, but it is up to you to do the itemization and the portion-sizing and estimating.   Don't let a bigger portion that someone else served obligate you into finishing it -- in fact, if that is your habit, then make it your new normal to always leave a little, if even just tiny, something of everything on the plate so that you unlearn that previous conditioning.\n\nSome cultural advice on moderation was to eat until 7/10ths full and then stop.

This is because it takes more energy for their bodies to simply exist/move around/etc. As you lose weight, your Total Daily Energy Expenditure will decrease, and you will have to consume fewer calories to maintain the same rate of weight loss as before. FWIW I use the LoseIt app and it adjusts my daily calorie target automatically when my weight goes down.",

Controlled diet breaks where you're maintain, mini bulks with very slight surpluses focusing on building lean body mass (high protein and heavy lifting).  Maybe one or two people somewhere have done the same exact thing through a very long weight loss journey, but, I strongly believe that 99.9% of people doing this have to mix it up to get out of a rut.

But the trick is to take it slow, and don't expect to lose it fast.  You don't WANT to lose it fast, you want to slowly adapt your body to a healthy weight long term.  \n\nWhen you hit a hard plateau, the answer isn't to starve yourself or tell your diet to go to hell.  The answer is to start slowly raising calories and bump your maintenance up as high as possible.  This will work better if you're lifting weights like you're supposed to be, because you'll start recomping muscle while getting leaner when you raise your calories, which will feel like magic.  I've gone from plateau at 2200 calories to more muscle and less fat at over 3000.   \n\nAnd once that period of recomping is over, which might take months, you lower by 500 again and start losing a pound a week.  You repeat this process until you get to your target weight, and you never have to starve yourself or get discouraged.\n\nThe exception would be a bodybuilder trying to get well below 10% bf.  Getting to bf levels that low will necessitate you be extremely hungry and feel like shit.

I was told maybe upping the calories to maintenance instead of deficit for a couple weeks can kind of help reset that. You also have to recalculate your caloric intake every couple months as your TDEE gets lower as your body weight gets lower so you may have to eat at an even lower calorie limit than you were originally. There are calculators that can help give you an idea at what your caloric intake goals should be and should be recalculated as needed. Eating a 500 deficit at 300 pounds will lose weight for a while but will eventually plateau and you will have to recalculate and eat at another 500 deficit based on your new calculation",

It's *possible* but healthy/sustainable weight loss is 1-2 pounds per week and you're looking at 2.5-3.

Putting the numbers into tdeecalculator.net I'm seeing a TDEE of ~2150 depending on your age. If you eat 1300/day that would be a deficit of 850 calories/day. If you do everything perfectly that comes out to a loss of 60 pounds in 247 days or a little over 8 months.

However keep reading because I\u2019m gonna tell you what WILL work - you may or may not like it \ud83d\ude0a \n\nHere\u2019s what will happen. \nYou will start strong, for a few days or weeks. You will cut your calories and do the exercise and be proud of yourself. You will deprive yourself of what you love, and do too much too soon.\nHowever then the weight on your joints doing that many steps everyday (because you have been doing it EVERY day) is going to lead to a painful injury. Guessing knee or hip. You will be depressed because you were \u201cdoing so well\u201d and slip back into eating for comfort because you are sore and depressed, and also exhausted from the huge crash diet you just put yourself on. \n\nIn a couple of months you will be back at the weight you were at before or a bit higher and feeling worse.\n\nHere is what you could do instead.\n\nMonth one. \nYou decide that you want to be healthier, so In the morning you wake up early and do some fasted walking. Walk for 30minutes or so, just in an area close to you. This will rack up 3-4000 steps depending on some factors. \nKeep your diet the same for now, but switch out your white carbs for wholemeal. Make an effort to incorporate a bit more salads and veg, but don\u2019t cut calories intentionally. You make sure that you are drinking enough water / fluids a day, and surprisingly you find you are naturally eating less because you feel fuller.\nLift weights a couple of times a week but not super heavy, or to the point where you hurt yourself. Basic workouts available on YouTube.\n\nMonth 2. \nOnce this has become and established habit (a month or so of doing the exercise 5-6 times a week) then try to drop the carbs a bit more (not completely) , and also stop eating after a certain time. I don\u2019t eat after dinner (and I also either do 16:8 or OMAD depending on the day, but we will get there.) You do this for another month, and notice that you are feeling a bit better, and that your fave looks a bit less puffy. You might decide to walk a little longer in the morning, or not. Either way is fine \ud83d\ude0a \n\nMonth 3.\nA month later, (when you are still doing the morning walking and are eating a little better) start tracking your calories, and making a conscious effort to monitor and reduce. Because your weight is quite high your TDEE is too, so aim for 1800-2000 for now. \n\nAt that point, the changes that you have made so far have become embedded and are easy to maintain. You may have found you really enjoy the quiet and tranquility of the morning walk, and getting up earlier means you are sleeping better. Maybe you have lost a few inches, and jeans feel a bit looser. You will look on the scale and not see many lbs lost, but that\u2019s okay.  \nMaybe you decide to cut down on your vice, whether that is chocolate or alcohol or pizza or whatever, but you will still have it once a week because nothing is banned. You decide to make that day your OMAD day where you go out with friends \ud83d\ude0a \n\nSeveral months later \nIt\u2019s now Christmas of this year, and you have easily and sustainably lost a noticeable amount of weight. Family members you only see at Christmas notice immediately and your Christmas jumper from last year is big and baggy. \nDespite only losing about 10-15kg on the scales, the difference in you as a person is huge. You are happier, enjoying your morning walk still, eating well. Your skin is bright and clear, and you feel fantastic. You look better in the photos than you have for years.  \n\nHere is the takeaway \n\n1. Excessive Exercise does very little at 240lbs, except making you think that you can eat more, hurting you and setting you back long term . You don\u2019t need to do thousands of steps every day to lose weight. Embedding the HABIT of regular exercise is far more easy to stick to long term (because that\u2019s what we want right?) \n\n2. Small dietary choices can add up. Mindful eating is important, and making healthy choices. \n\n3. You will see changes in Inches WAY faster than you will see changes on the scales. Giving yourself such a huge goal weight will only demotivate you when you haven\u2019t met that goal next week. \nInstead, measure your waist, hips, arms and thighs now. When you weigh yourself again next month (which is something you will do on a set day of every month and not everyday or week, because we girls fluctuate a LOT). \nAbsolutely give yourself a goal weight, but go onto a BMI tracker and find out what weight you will have to be to go down a category in obesity. Do it for HEALTH not vanity.\nYou will probably find you are meeting these targets faster than you think which is incredibly motivating. \n\nI was literally where you are a year ago, and I\u2019m here for you if you want to talk \ud83d\ude0a it\u2019s hard but making the change from \u201cI\u2019m gonna go on a crazy crash diet because I am just so depressed\u201d to \u201cactually I want to be healthy for the rest of my life\u201d is one that will really benefit you long term.",

In the past I pushed myself too fast and injured myself (knees), after 8 months I am up to 4 mph for 30 minutes.  But twice a week for me is doable, and sustainable, which is key.  \n\nDon't rush it or push yourself too hard too fast.  Those are my 2 cents.  Very best of luck,  it can be done.",
                "1200 is too low. Try 1700-1800. 120g of protein(or .8 per pound of your goal weight, we\u2019re just so similar in height and this is what im doing) and aim for 25-30g of fiber. If you by some miracle push through with 1200 a day, you will very quickly gain it back. Focus on developing better habits that you can sustain long term. I know it\u2019s hard to be patient but think of it like this, time is going to pass anyway, dont rush it. \n\nYou will see great progress with 1700-1800. I\u2019m 5\u201d2 and was 218 at my heaviest. I dropped an average of 8-10 a month doing what i just told you as well as getting 7-8 hours of sleep at night. Dont underestimate how important sleep is. I didnt lose a single pound when i was averaging 4-5 hours asleep and as soon as i was sleeping 8, i dropped 3 pounds in 2 weeks eating exactly the same as i was when i was barely sleeping. Time went faster when i focused more on overall health rather than just weight loss. Consistency is your friend. When i wanted to rush it and under eat, id binge so bad that it would negate the days i under ate. That being said, on the days you accidentally go over your calories, dont restrict the next day. Just go about as normal. It will all be fine. Last week i overate by 1000 calories one day and still dropped a pound the next day. Trust the process!\n\nI truly wish the best for you and that you can reach your goals. You can absolutely do it but dont be so hard on yourself.\n\nEdit: carbs are not your enemy. They give you energy!! Sugar is also not your enemy. Just dont overdo either!",

The diet worked great and I lost a ton of weight very fast, starting in the beginning of July to mid October I had gotten down to 219lbs. I then started a new job and didn\u2019t have the energy I needed to continue the exercise routine I had going on, plus the severely cut calories, while also performing well at the new job, and it all suddenly became incredibly difficult to manage.\n\nI was very hard on myself for \u201cfailing\u201d even though I simply wasn\u2019t losing at the same rate anymore, it affected my mental health and I completely gave up. This resulted in me gaining back all the weight plus more.\n\nIt really isn\u2019t sustainable and won\u2019t reach you long term habits, and this is something I am figuring out how to implement myself. It\u2019s more difficult imo since I\u2019ve always been the type that does all or nothing, but sometimes getting in the middle zone is the best way for long term success.",

See my post history for the extraneous circumstances but truly eating less moving more and cooking were the 3 basic things I did consistently. I don\u2019t think you should restrict yourself more than abstaining from eating out and drinking alcohol/anything but water tea and basic coffee. Start small. My trainer recommended I serve myself the amount of food I normally would then pack away half for the next day as a no nonsense way to cut calories.",

If you have never done such calory restriction for an extended amount of time (like 2 weeks) it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll success without a lot of willpower. Most people fail at this for a reason, people who do not have no problem \u201cnot gaining weight\u201d in the first place usually because they have the willpower not to overeat. So think about if you\u2019ll really be able to manage this for weeks, like try it for two weeks first. If not, you should probably start slowly and change your daily habits slowly.",

Take it from someone who has lost well over 100 lbs. you do not want to do that, you will lose so much muscle and give yourself mounds of loose hanging skin. Start by increasing activity (steps) 15,000 can be a lot depending on where you are starting from and if it\u2019s from 7,000 or less your are going to drastically increase your hunger, disrupt sleep etc. start by trying to be consistent with something more manageable like 1,800 calories to 2,100 calories ( you will still be a in a deficit!) and depending I. How many steps you get currently try to add 1,000-3,000 and see how you can manage that for 4 weeks. You will likely see drastic changes just from a consistent deficit and increased activity. You don\u2019t have to go balls to the wall to see progress. And this is super important start weight training, start maybe 2 -3 days a week. So many programs and tips for free on instagram.

But if they're looking for a magic solution, I often will just say \"idk I just ate less and moved more haha and it went away\". That usually gets them to back off, because they'll think I just have a fast metabolism or something.",
                "Because its simple but hard, and we have a huge blind-spot with those things. Simple and easy, great I'll just go do it. Complicated and hard, at least I can see why I'm struggling. Complicated and easy, ok so I just need it to click ugh. Simple and hard leaves you feeling like you're missing something, it can't *just* be this or I'd have done it already, what is it?\n\nThey're listening for you to tell them its complicated but easy and the one weird trick is ... . So when you tell them \"I eat less\" sure, I know that, but that's the simple part what's the complicated bit. We know what's missing is consistency, and we know that just because the big picture is easy applying it sustainably to your life isn't.",
                "I'm not sure if they really want to know about some miracle thing or if they want to be convinced that it is some fad diet so that you're doomed to fail. No, I don't think that they want to see you fail, but you failing means they don't need to put in this \"massive amount of willpower\" to lose weight because they will fail too which means they don't need to change anything now and can stay where they are.",

Sometimes people just can\u2019t see past the idea of a magic solution, but that doesn\u2019t take away from how awesome and inspiring your progress is. Keep doing what you're doing, sticking with sustainable changes is the way to go. \ud83d\udcaa\u2728",

I myself had to heal my relationship with food so I understand it\u2019s not easy but it just amazes me how some people refuse to accept how weightloss works when presented with first hand experience from someone who was able to change.  \n\nI think that what might mislead them is that I ate quite a lot when we sat down together. But I also told them that I didn\u2019t eat much that day because I was \u201csaving\u201d my calories that day so I could eat with them.",
                "I always make sure to tell people who ask how I managed it that I took it really slow with all the changes and that it got easier with time. I tell them that I know how hard it is to take the first step but it\u2019s possible. What makes me sad is that my sister\u2019s MIL told me that she just won\u2019t eat for some time so she can lose some weight after she gains weight after she starts eating again. It makes me sad because I myself have history with disordered eating. I want to help others overcome their problems with it but sometimes people refuse to understand.",

For example, a 5'5\" woman between age 20 - 29 burns about 2000 calories per day. \n\nDoctors, nutritionists, and experts recommend losing weight slowly and 5 pounds per month is the general consensus as being what works best (long term) for most people. In summary, to lose 5 pounds per month, ***you need to limit your eating to 1450 calories per day.*** \n\nIf you don't own a food scale (for measuring food portions), you need to order one from Amazon immediately. They are usually around $15 to $20 and you just search for \"food scale\" and pick one that's very simple and easy to use. (unless you like complicated technology)\n\nIf you are rich, you can join a food delivery program like Nutrisystem that ships your meals to you with all the calorie info already calculated with all your meals planned on your calendar but then you are losing a valuable skill of learning how to measure and weigh your food to roughly determine how many calories it has. \n\nIn case this has been a long read, the most important thing I have wrote is this: ***you need to limit your eating to 1450 calories per day.*** Lastly, make sure you **[don't lie to yourself about what you eat](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1coszbb/confessions_of_a_an_xdeluded_dieter/).**",

I have taken the suggestions of the very generous people here and put many of them in place, for example, making sure to eat something in the morning.  I am still noticing that I am eating more emotionally later in the day, albeit in smaller and healthier amounts.  It crossed my mind that making another room other than the kitchen more pleasing to be in during the evening might help.  Also, I realized that I wear very loose clothes in the evening.  Has anyone found that it's easier to make good decisions when they are wearing clothes that are a bit tighter?  Other reasonably easy tips?  Thanks again!",

                "Well, I have noticed that it's easier to cave in when I'm wearing loose stuff. It's when I put on tighter stuff the next day that I have major regrets lol. It's something I've considered trying, like wearing the drawstring shorts so that I feel uncomfortable BEFORE I feel uncomfortable, if that makes sense.",
                "Hmm.  Might be something worthy of an experiment: combining greater conscious thought and tighter clothes to give a warning of early signs of discomfort.  Wonder if anything to slow down would help too; i.e., giving time for early signs of fullness or discomfort to fully register."

                "This is the biggest mistake people make when dieting. It is hard enough to supress your appetite long enough to lose the excess weight, but you can't supress it forever. So what happens is even if you do lose the weight, you eventually go back to eating normal and with insufficient activity to offset that, you regain the weight all over again. The latest study shows 95% failure rate.\n\nA CICO diet actually looks like this ...\n\n1. Lose the weight - Eat less and exercise more\n2. Keep it off - Eat normal and exercise normal\n\nUnfortunately, people think it is this (basically only a CI diet) ...\n\n1. Lose the weight - Eat less\n2. Keep it off - Eat less\n\nAnd you simply do not have that kind of control over you diet to eat less forever. Thus 95% fail.\n\nWhen I was 255 lbs, my sedentary TDEE (what I was eating) was 2300. So I eat 1500 cals and exercised for 9 months till my weight was 160. My sedentary TDEE at 160 would have been 1800. But the average cals for a 5'7\" male is more like 2200 to 2300. Essentially what I was eating when I was 255 and sedentary.\n\nThat is roughly my natural appetite. Actually roughly the appetite of all 5'7\" males.\n\nIn any event \"eat normal\" will be closer to 2300 than to 1800, and the only way to eat normal is to have sufficient physical activity to offset it. So, I workout an hour each morning 5 days a week and all is good now. I am back to how I was in my early 20's, active and in the sevice, how did you put it? \"I was always slim without even trying\"\n\nWell, it is true I wasn't trying back then because I didn't have to. My job and my lifestyle gave me the activity, and I ate roughly the same as now, the same as all my life. It was when I started a desk job and became more and more sedentary that my weight kept creeping up. The majority of my weight gain, and the majority of all weight gain below BMI 40 is due to sedentary behavior.\n\nA proper diet should chage your state from sedentary and obese to moderately active and normal weight. You can fix bad food habits and practice moderation, but you can't significantly eat below your natural appetite. That is why step 1 is so hard. You have to eat below your natural appetite for months or years even. But you ultimate goal should be to be able to return to your natural appetite and be active enough such that you don't gain weight again.\n\nThe ACSM recommend 300 minutes a week or moderate to vigorous activity for this purpose.\n\n[Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition (health.gov)](https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf)\n\n\"People who are at a healthy body weight, but slowly gaining weight, can either gradually increase their level of physical activity (toward the equivalent of 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity) or reduce caloric intake, or both, until their weight is stable. That is, by regularly checking body weight, people can fnd the amount of physical activity that works for them.\"\n\n\"Many adults will need to do more than the 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity to lose weight or keep it off. These adults should do more physical activity and/or further reduce their caloric intake. Some people will need to do the equivalent of 300 or more minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a week to meet their body-weight goals. In addition to restricting caloric intake, these adults should gradually increase minutes or the intensity of aerobic physical activity, to the point at which the physical activity is effective in achieving a healthy weight.\"\n\nYou will have to find that balance where you can eat enough to be full (satiated) but have sufficient actvity to balance. That balance is generally closer to moderately active than it is to sedentary.",

I cut out fizzy drinks for the sugar free alternatives (I still have the proper stuff occasionally but it's maybe a couple of times a month as opposed to having a full 2L bottle worth every day). I cut out frozen food entirely because there's absolutely no nutritional value in those sorts of things, I opted to build my meals around a big portion of meat (beef, chicken or mince) and then some veg with another carb source (I love rice and pasta so I often have those on the side). I'm mindful of portion sizes now I weigh out certain things like rice where as before I'd just pour it into the pot and only stop pouring when I felt like there was enough in there. \n\nThere was definitely some trial and error with my eating, I started off immediately trying to do OMAD (one meal a day) and that only lasted about 4/5 days before I stopped because not only was I hungry, tired and feeling terrible often it was also hard to consume enough calories for a 183cm 165kg person in one sitting when you're not eating unhealthy processed stuff. I eventually started fasting, I've not been as strict with it as of late but generally for about 75% of this journey I was eating in an 8 hour window between midday and 8pm, it helped reduce snacking as once 8pm came around I knew that was it, kitchen was closed\ud83d\ude02\n\nI wouldn't really say I did anything major, I just educated myself more about nutrition and went from there really. I usually eat the same meals at the same time every day, I understand to some that can get repetitive but ultimately I've changed my relationship with food, I no longer eat for pleasure, I eat to fuel my body to perform at an optimal level so whatever helps achieve that is what I ate and will continue to eat! \n\nI suppose I'll touch on exercise too as while nutrition is the main thing, exercise is definitely important as well! I just started walking initially, I'd walk for about an hour in the evening (about 6k steps or so) for the first few months and then I started strength training in November and I haven't stopped since! I love it! I started off with a pretty basic push-pull-leg routine (you can find dozens online) and then I've altered it a bit as I learnt more and become more physically capable of doing certain things! \n\nI can't really think of anything else to add, if you have any other questions let me know and I'll answer them the best I can!",

                "A bulk is when you eat a lot of food and lift weights to gain muscle. Like many people, you only did the first half so no you will just lose the fat and still not have very much muscle until you start lifting. The sooner you start lifting the better and the easier it will be so don't waste time",
                "You didn0't start on a dirty bulk, you were just fat. Bulking means building as much muscle mass as possible, when is dirty builk you just don't care as much about also adding fat. If you are building muscle and losing fat, you're jsut doing a body recomp.",

I started this effort in 2014 from 298.\n\n>  since I basically started off on a \"dirty bulk\" will it help my physique once I get leaner? \n\nYes, provided that you lifted then as you gained it and you're lifting now (to preserve it) as you lose.      \n\nOtherwise, it wasn't a bulk but just getting fat.   That, too, is worth preserving the muscle that you gained from ambulating a 310 body around 24/7/365 -- as long as you plan on lifting in the future, you should lift now.  \n\nHowever, that 310 muscle isn't *needed.*   If you don't care about keeping that muscle or doing strength training all that much, you can let it go.   We still should exercise and include some strength training, but we only need the muscle that we actually need to be healthy.   It isn't that 310 muscle when we're 155 now, but we could keep all of it if we want to.",

I do have some advice though!  \n\nIt sounds like you are extremely results oriented, but are struggling with actually making and keeping the changes. When people lose weight, they often make unsustainable changes, because they can handle it for a few weeks, but can\u2019t actually keep doing it forever. It sounds like you\u2019re in a cycle of restricting (\u201ctightening up\u201d, cutting out meals) just to see progress, but then getting tired of it or simply not being able to sustain and then falling back to your old ways. \n\nMy question to you is, why did you start eating out again and drinking? It seems like you think those are incompatible with losing weight, and therefore when you do them you stop making an effort to stay in a deficit. Eating out and drinking aren\u2019t actually the problem, and you CAN fit them into a deficit if you plan correctly and are mindful! \n\nYou aren\u2019t going to lose the weight and get to do whatever you want. You have to figure out how to do everything you enjoy, in a way that keeps you eating only what you need. Figure out how to eat at restaurants for fewer calories (take home half, order lighter meals), or how to drink in a way that isn\u2019t 1000 cals+ a night (tricky, but depending on what you\u2019re actually drinking you may be able to eliminate hundreds of calories). \n\nRight now you just want to be a pound or two down on the scale, but if you want to sustain you have to change what you want and learn the relationship with food that gives you and sustains a smaller body in the long run. Is the way you\u2019re handling food right now something you can do forever?",

My only real tips for navigating alcohol are use sugar free mixers and try to drink less.\n\n\nIf you\u2019re not losing weight (long term, a few weeks or so. Day-to-day weight fluctuates WILDLY, apps like Happy Scale that take an average can help) then you\u2019re consuming more energy than you\u2019re using. If you can track your intake safely, I\u2019d recommend it. It gives a lot of perspective on your habits and what you\u2019re actually eating, and it can be easier to find swaps or see where you might be eating hundreds of calories you didn\u2019t realize. \n\nSome people find calorie counting triggers eating disorder symptoms, but for others (including me) it actually helps counteract them. Instead of feeling the need to restrict so I can see a loss, I can tell exactly how much I\u2019ve eaten already and basically know what I\u2019ll lose. It encourages me to make sure I\u2019m eating enough and make full use of my calorie goal for the day. If my goal is 1400 and I\u2019ve only had 1200, I\u2019ll have a nice dessert to fill it out :) \n\nI\u2019d also recommend having some other goals - body measurements, clothes, fitness goals, they\u2019ll all give you other ways to feel like you\u2019re making progress other than your weight. \n\nAnd meal prep may help with the convenience of eating out! \n\nI\u2019ve thrown a lot at you but I hope at least some of it will be helpful and encouraging! \ud83d\ude05"

That is the best gauge (outside of a medical reason for you have higher body fat) of whether you are eating well or not. You can theoretically lose 10-20kg by exercising more but it will be a whole lot easier if you compliment it by decreasing your caloric intake (to a caloric deficit level slightly below your caloric maintenance level). \n\nThe way I describe a weight loss journey to people is like trying to drive a car from point A (starting point) to point b (goal). Controlling what you eat and eating in a caloric deficit is like the ability to start the car. Exercising is like the ability to accelerate the car. Having the car in neutral while trying to accelerate may push the car forward slightly but it is likely not meaningful. So your diet is the key to weight loss success. An diet doesn't need to be a dirty word like starving yourself. It just means you eat more healthy, be more mindful of how much you eat and try to reduce eating unhealthy/junk food. \n\nBest of luck."

                "There\u2019s more going on here. You\u2019re describing a binge and restrict cycle. Depriving yourself during the week and wondering why you overcompensate on a \u201ccheat day\u201d? Of course you are, who wouldn\u2019t? \n\nGet rid of cheat days. Mix in your tasty foods with the rest of your eating schedule all week. You want to pound a thousand calories of cheeseburger and fries? You\u2019ve got another 800-1000 to play with that day (making some assumptions about your height and weight, your experience may vary). \n\nAt the movies you\u2019ve built a habit where movie time=eating time. You can dismantle that if you want to. Don\u2019t buy any food at your next movie. When your brain yells at you and says \u201chey dumbass go get some food\u201d tell it to shut up. You\u2019ll be uncomfortable for 10 minutes and then you can go back to laughing at Deadpool or whatever. \n\nLastly, if you know weed and booze are triggers, either wean off them or make it harder for yourself to indulge when you do partake. Easier said than done I know but think about what you\u2019re giving up (health, confidence, strength, good sleep) for the momentary pleasure of food, drink, and weed. Is it really worth it? \n\nTldr: you\u2019ve built some habits that are triggers for overeating.

I'm trying to make sustainable changes that will last a lifetime... if I have cheat days, that means I'm \"dieting\" and I'm cheating on my diet. I don't want to diet. I just want to live my life and eat a healthy amount of food for my goal weight.\n\nI still celebrate here and there or have days where I go over my recommended calories. Today is my 11 year anniversary, for example, and I am going out to eat tonight and will most certainly go over my limit today. This isn't a cheat day though... it's just part of my life. And I'm not going to starve myself in advance because I know that would result in me overstuffing myself at dinner. I'm also not going to restrict additional calories tomorrow to make up for it because that can result in binging, also. Instead, I'm fine with the idea that special occasions (not weekly things) are reasons to overeat a bit and one meal isn't going to send me back 6 months and 50+ lbs. As long as I keep chugging along with what I'm doing to stay healthy after the nice meal, I'm good. And I'm not cheating, I'm just living my life.",
                "i can tell you with certainty that if you continue doing what you\u2019re doing, with or without the cheat days, you are going to keep binging. you\u2019re too hard on yourself, you overthink about eating, you make rash impulsive decisions, and you decide that you\u2019ve already fucked up, so why not make it worse. that\u2019s not just a food problem, it\u2019s something more. \n\ni did the same exact thing as you, heavily restricted, had one cheat day a week where i replenished all of those calories that i\u2019d just worked off. one core piece of advice i have is to not attach as much power to food anymore\u2013 wingstop will always be there. alcohol will always be there. you will have millions of more chances to go eat those foods and drink those drinks without feeling guilt. it\u2019s not a cheat, it\u2019s *life.* you can even still indulge in those things without binging on them. i fit chick fil a into my calorie limit everyday by just slightly switching up my usual order. at the movies, bring your own huge bag of skinny pop, a massive diet coke slushy, and sf bears or something to at least minimize the effects of the binge while still having the satiating feeling. eventually you\u2019ll get to a point where you don\u2019t have that scarcity mindset and you can eat comfortably.\n\nby telling yourself you CAN\u2019T have it, and you can\u2019t even THINK about eating it, you make it a gift or a reward when you do finally have it. What that leads to for me is overeating because I want more and more and more of that reward as a prize and dopamine for just having starved, and then you can\u2019t stop, and when you finally run out you crash and feel nothing but shame and restart the cycle over again. \n\ndo some soul searching, up your intake, and be kind to yourself.",

                "I can only speak from my experience, but, as someone who struggled with binge eating disorder from a very young age, I can say that this pattern you are in is very much how binge eating disorder works. \n\nI used to do the same exact thing. For years and years. I'd restrict, only eating very small amounts of very traditionally healthy food. Some attempts I never let myself have anything that wasn't super healthy, others I would start with a free day on the weekend...which would start moderate but soon balloon into a massive constant binge for two days straight. And then....I'd just go over the edge and binge for months on end. \n\nMy suspicion is that first, you are cutting your calories way too much. Get an app, go online, etc, and input your height and weight and activity level and find out your maintenance calories. Then, simply aim for eating less than that daily. And it doesn't have to be a lot less. Start small. 100 calories, 200. Yes, weight loss may be slow but it sure beats the massive weight gain that comes with binge eating. Cutting too much and being too strict, for a binge eater, is the number one way to trigger binges. It's not that you are weak, etc etc. Restriction is just really not great for a binge inclined mind. \n\nSecond, using cheat to describe food sets you up for failure. Food is neutral. I finally learned that I actually can eat just about anything and, as long as I am in a deficit, still lose weight. I'm down 44 lbs. Some weeks? I have mod pizza three times a week. It's not a cheat and it's nothing I feel bad about. I just log however much I plan to eat as my meal and build the day around it. I'm in grad school, I work full time and I have 2 side jobs. I'm busy. So some weeks, most if my dinners are out, whether I grab a burger or whatever else. I'd love to cook every day but I just don't have time. However, as long as I'm under my calorie goal for the day, I feel fine and the scale goes down. This for me has been novel. I truly would truly when i was younger eating an insanely low amount of calories, and all of it was like..salad and oatmeal and fruit. \n\nIt truly us better to eat a bit more daily and have foods that our brains want to label as \"bad\" frequently than to be super strict and have a binge weekly. I suspect if you sit and calculate the calories of your \"cheats\" it would be a huge amount, and, it would be massively more than if you simply relaxed throughout the week and ate a little bit more, and ate more things you enjoy. \n\nYou are building a really unhealthy relationship with food and, I speak from experience: it's very, very hard to break, especially if you keep feeding it. For me, therapy and a binge eating coach helped greatly. If that isn't your thing, there are lots of excellent podcasts and resources out there that can help. There are ways to learn how to take power away from foods and integrate them into your life.",
                "\u201cCheat days\u201d are the wrong way to think about. Even \u201ccheat meals\u201d isn\u2019t a great way to think about it. \n\nYou should instead think of your diet flexibility as a \u201crainy day fund\u201d / \u201cemergency savings account.\u201d\n\nThe idea should be that as long as you\u2019re staying on-track every day, then when special situations arise where sticking to your diet would be difficult or a bummer, you\u2019ve banked enough progress that you can give a little back. \n\nSally shows up to the office with those cronuts (or whatever might be cool/special at the time) that everyone is talking / raving about?  Have one. Your friend invites you to the baseball game? Get a hot dog and a beer. Your spouse wants to get deep dish pizza on her birthday?  Don\u2019t be an asshole and make them eat alone while you eat the Cesar salad. Have a slice or two with them.  Been running around town with your kid and the two of you are famished?  Stop in at McDonald\u2019s. Have a Big Mac. (But maybe skip the fries and get a diet soda.)\n\nBut otherwise you need to figure out a diet that doesn\u2019t feel like a \u201cdiet\u201d but rather just a lifestyle. If you can\u2019t be happy and fulfilled eating what you\u2019re eating most days, you need to go back to the drawing board.  \n\nThat\u2019s why people who lose weight slowly keep it off. First off, by the time they hit their goal weight they\u2019ve been sticking with their diet for a long time. But secondly the moderately-restrictive diet plan that they\u2019ve been on is more likely something they can stick with once they\u2019ve arrived at their destination.  The people who do the extreme diets get to their goal weight and suddenly need to figure out a whole new plan, because intermittent fasting + keto + 15k steps per day isn\u2019t likely a reasonable desirable long-term lifestyle.",

Even if it\u2019s a conscious decision to do these things, beating yourself up won\u2019t be what helps you overcome. \nWhat WILL help is engaging in positive self-talk followed by positive action. Allowing yourself to understand that while you are in a deficit, that some hunger is gonna happen. Not choosing the wings or popcorn or candy or whatever isn\u2019t a forever choice- it\u2019s a today choice. And if you decide today to do it, you decide how much- ahead of time. For me this has meant I often simply don\u2019t choose it. Or if I do, it\u2019s limited and whatever my body does to respond then I have to deal accordingly. \n\nIt\u2019s not about perfection- it\u2019s about consistency.

                "I recommend abolishing cheat days, and just being more flexible with your diet more often. If I REALLY want a cheeseburger, I get the dang cheeseburger regardless of which day it is. But I skip any high calorie toppings/sides that I'm not specifically craving. Usually that means a cheeseburger with LTO, pickles, ketchup, and mustard with water to drink and maybe 5 of my husband's fries. Sometimes, I gotta have my own fries or bacon or special sauce or SOMETHING but try not to do all of those things every single time. \n\nOut of control cravings are a sign that you are restricting too much. The solution is to take a maintenance break. Eating at maintenance will give you more flexibility with your portion size and what you eat. It's a good idea to stick to your good habits when in maintenance, just with more calories to play with: tracking daily, weighing regularly, getting enough water, protein, and fiber to feel physically full. Once you're feeling refreshed (one week to multiple months depending on how long you've been in a deficit without a break), get after it again!",
                "I think the trick here is to eat all of this stuff during your normal days, just in moderation. None of these foods by themselves are going to kill you, you just clearly crave them and feel the need to\nmake up for denying them. Build them into your week at different points, and you won\u2019t feel the need to binge all day one day. Maybe just make little adjustments to keep it moving - either do the double burger by itself or a regular burger if you also want medium Cajun fries. Maybe lightly butter the popcorn, or divide the bag of sweets into 3 and get 3 days of snacks out of it? \n\nI think the biggest lesson from this shouldn\u2019t be that you need to be more disciplined about your cheat days, it\u2019s that cheat days and \u201cgood\u201d days are generally not a super sustainable lifestyle. You\u2019re going to be eating for the rest of your life, and you likely won\u2019t be able to fully cut out all of your favorite foods, nor should you want to. Just make them a normal part of your habits that you\u2019re conscious of and you\u2019re good to go.",

Congratulations on your success \n\nI know some people like or don't like when people notice the difference.\n\nIt's important to understand the psychology of where this comes from so you don't feel negative mentally.\n\nI'd take it as validation of all your hard work. Weight loss, especially a large amount, is a physical alteration. It's not something secretly kept behind closed doors, or a tattoo kept under a piece of clothing no one can see.\n\nI have a good sense of humour, so I remember joking to someone who noticed I had lost a bunch of weight a while back, \"thanks for calling me fat before, Kevin\" haha. I laughed but he stumbled on his words to try and apologize. I knew it wasn't what he meant and I was definitely joking with him and I told him so and thanked him. We were close and I know anyone who's ever noticed or commented or congratulated me came with zero malice. They were simply using their senses and noticing.\n\nWhether people want the comments or not, sometimes it's just a response. Like if a colleague has long dark hair one day then the next she walks in with a bright pink pixie cut, people will notice that there's a difference. Whether they say anything or not. \n\nChances are, if you gained a lot of weight, no one would say anything. People have enough decorum not to point out something that commonly is a sore spot or none of their business as to the cause, but noticing that you've lost weight is usually a congratulatory celebratory comment on your success and hard work. And usually an intended set goal that was achieved.\n\nMy advice is, eventually people will stop praising you and just be used to the new way you look. You'll even meet new people who never knew you when you were heavy and it'll just be you. But I guarantee you'll be the office go to for success stories, or perhaps land a new project because you've shown you can commit to something and get the job done! You're probably an inspiration to your peers and more. \n\nDon't let their praise or comments hit you as 'you used to be worthless, or I noticed you were fat before'. Those are lies we tell ourselves. Those are things we hear, not what people are saying.\n\nYou've done a great thing and you should be proud, and you should keep going! If people notice, let them admire you and be inspired by you, and then let them treat you like normal when the novelty wears off and you'll just be regular you, but a happier healthier version.\n\nAnd of course, at the end of the day we can't control what people think, say or do. And no one's thoughts or opinions matter more than your own. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f",

I've been reading articles online about diet, and how it's the most important part of weight loss. But when I look up how many calories I should consume a day to lose weight, and it said to lose moderate weight (.5 a week) that 1748 is good, and in order to lose 2 lbs a week that I should do 995 calories a day. Is this safe, and accurate to consume so little calories? Should I start off with a greater calorie intake then work my way down? ",

                "Start at 1,800 and see how it goes. You could safely go down to 1,500 if you want, but it shouldn't be necessary.",
                "I definitely wouldn't consume 995 that's just far too low. I threw some stats into a TDEE calculator at sedentary level (I guessed your height at 5'5 just because you didn't mention it, if you're taller then obviously it'll be a slightly higher and vice versa) but it came back with 2400. While TDEE calcs can be a a bit off by a few hundred calories, they're definitely a good starting point. So basically to lose roughly 1.5lbs per week (which is a good aim for most people) you'd be talking around 1650 calories. I would suggest starting out somewhere in the 1600-1800 range for the first month or so, see how you feel and see how the progress goes. If you need to you can drop it a bit more but I wouldn't go below 1400/1500 personally, at least not right away. It's important to see how your body reacts to eating in a pretty big deficit before going into an even bigger one. Good luck mate you've got this!\ud83d\ude0a",
                "There\u2019s a whole range of weight loss between 0.5 lbs a week and 2 lbs a week. I started at about your same weight and tracked carefully, first to see how many calories I was actually consuming. After a week or two I limited myself to 2000, then went down to about 1800 and stayed there for a while. Once the weight started coming off I recalculated my TDEE every 10 lbs or so for a slight reduction in calories each time.\n\nYou should stay above 1200 calories though. 995 calories is not enough to keep you healthy while you lose weight, and going from no restriction to such a large restriction will make it so much more difficult to stick with the change. Start by just tracking, or maybe start at 1800 and give it time.",
                "Go at a speed that's sustainable, I understand the want to lose weight fast but if you go fast but then quit a month later your going to just regain all that weight. I would say start at 1800-1500 calories and adjust as you go. If you want to increase calories burned do some weight training, the more muscles you have the more calories you burn from just sitting.",
                "I personally dislike websites that tell you to eat under 1200 calories a day...that is generally considered the minimum for any adult regardless of size (both a petite 4'11\" woman and a 7'0\" male bodybuilder have a brain that consumes roughly the same amount of energy). Unless you talk with your doctor and decide that eating under 1200 is ok for you I definitely recommend against it. Eating at a deficit is difficult enough, at 995 calories a day you really start to sacrifice your executive functions. Weight loss is slow and you've got a lot of life to live in the meantime! \n\n  \nI recommend starting at that 1,748 and letting yourself adjust from there. If you're feeling more ambitious you can definitely go down further, but please don't do 995 calories a day (unless your doctor disagrees with me). However the important thing is that you find a target that you can sustain for slow progress over time. May take some experimentation but I'm confident you will find your happy place!",

I got down to 175, but now I\u2019m pregnant with twins so I\u2019ll have to start over after they\u2019re born this fall \ud83d\udc9b\n\nI totally love your idea of chose your hard and 100% agree that while it is hard to lose weight it is also very hard to be so overweight.

I've considered really giving intermittent fasting a try but haven't been consistent in the past. I'm at 400lbs now after gaining 80lbs during the pandemic and everything hurts all the time so I'm really wanting to actually do something about it this time as I'm nearly turning 40 and miserable.\n\nThank you for sharing your update!  :)",

You can try either approach.

                "Water weight is a hell of a drug, combine that with periods and the scale is going to fluctuate wildly. I'm a man who's been aiming to lose 2 pounds a week, and while I do average that over the course of any 8 week period in my cut, on a week to week basis the numbers fluctuate wildly. Just using my own past 8 weeks for weight loss (this is Monday to Monday)\n\n0.8\n1.6\n1.0\n1.8\n1.8\n3.8\n3.2\n1.6\n\nAverage of 1.95 a week, and I can tell you already I'm already down 3.2 for this week having done an end of the week check in this morning. That'll move my 8 week rolling average to 2.15 pounds lost a week.\n\nFun fact, when I did my mid week check last Friday, I would have been down 2.2 pounds if I logged it then, Sunday I had pizza for dinner, and my weight loss Monday morning was the 0.8 you see. Did I actually gain 1.4 pounds in 3 days? Obviously not, heck I stayed in my caloric deficit all weekend, including the pizza on Sunday, but the blast of carbs caused my body to retain more water.\n\nOther fun fact, 2 weeks ago I was sick and everyday was a cheat day until I got better, still lost weight on a w2w basis. The only way a cheat meal/day will completely destroy your progress is if\n\n1) Your cheat meal/day is excessive. If you're aiming for 500 calorie deficit a day without exercise, by the end the week you've accrued a 3,000 calorie deficit. If your cheat meal/day ends in a 3,000 calorie surplus, your cheat meal/day \"destroyed your progress\". That said I'd argue eating at maintenance is still a win when you have a lot of weight to lose, and it's important to have weeks you practice eating at maintenance cause it'll be your life.\n\n2) Your actual caloric day to day tracking has been inaccurate. Same example as above, but since you've been less diligent that 500 calorie deficit is actually only 250, it would mean you accrued a deficit of 1,500 for the week. Now your 3,000 calorie cheat day leads to you having a 1,500 calorie surplus for the week.

                "I would suggest waiting a month before making and crazy pivots to your current diet and exercise strategies. Track your weight weekly and take monthly progress photos. Even if you don't see much progress on the scale, you might see it in the photos. If after a month there's factually no progress or you've gone the wrong direction, that's when it's time to reassess. Check your portion sizes for your homemade meals and/or increase your calorie estimates for what you eat, lower the amount of calories you estimate you've burned while exercising, accept that your tdee might be lower than the calculator and try cutting an extra 200-500 calories a day. Do that, try for a month, and see what happens. I know 1-2 months might sound like forever to make slow changes to your diet if you feel like you're making no progress, but look at the big picture. If you have 40-60 years left of life on this Earth, is it really gonna matter if it took you 16 months vs 19 months to reach your target weight? Either way you'll have to keep working towards maintaining for years and years, better to take a few more months and get your diet/maintenance plan right than rush, not learn good habits, and undo all your work in 2-3 years."

And that feeling of hunger gets in the way of losing weight.  \n  \nBut as I understand, fullness is mostly affected by how much protein is in the food and how much fiber it contains, as fibers take long to digest (please correct me if I'm wrong, as I am a newbie).  \n  \nDoes that mean that a meal that consists of, for example, chicken breast and vegetables would be very filling and make you feel full, even if the portion is relatively small?

If we manage it well, we typically won't feel hungry before or after our regular meals.  \n\n> But as I understand, fullness is mostly affected by how much protein is in the food and how much fiber it contains\n\nLet's not make fullness a goal.  Let's make the goal the general absence of hunger.  We tend to plan and time our meals to avoid hunger.  We don't eat to feel full or stuffed, but to provide energy and nutrients that keep us until our next meal.  \n\nIn the hunger scale, we're aiming at a 5.\n\n# The Hunger Scale \n\n\n\\#|Description\n:-:|:--\n1|Starving, weak, dizzy\n2|Very hungry, cranky, low energy, lots of stomach growling\n3|Pretty hungry, stomach is growling a little\n4|Starting to feel a little hungry\n5|Satisfied, neither hungry nor full\n6|A little full, pleasantly full\n7|A little uncomfortable\n8|Feeling stuffed\n9|Very uncomfortable, stomach hurts\n10|So full you feel sick\n\nSometimes 6 happens, sometimes we'll eat to 4 and, after the meal 20 minutes later we are at a 5. \n\nStuffed-ness is about the food's bulk and the speed at which we're putting it down.  Low-starch or non-starchy greens and vegetables are probably the most bulky https://i.imgur.com/HefZBZR.png  and, yes, they tend to have more fiber.\n\nFiber passes through two ways.  Soluble fiber becomes gel-like and makes us absorb food more slowly and lubricates the digestion process as it passes through.  Insoluble fiber (roughage) passes through pretty much unchanged.  We don't have to know or worry about the difference.  Mainly, if it's a low-fiber or no-fiber carbohydrate, it's not going to solve hunger for as long or keep it away as well as something that has 10% or 20% or more of its carbs as fiber.\n\n> What about nuts and fruits?\n\nNuts are a fat.  Yes, they have both carbs/fiber and protein, but they're the shadow of the number of fat calories.  Nuts are great sources of our necessary Omega 3 fatty acids.  Fats are more than 2x as calorie dense as proteins or carbs, so a little goes a very long way.   Fats are also the longest-lasting (satiating) macronutrient, so a meal with a good amount of fat in it will have a better chance of getting you to your next meal without hunger than one with too little fat in it.\n\nFruits are carbs, and fruits like berries are heavier in fiber than fruits like watermelon or banana or grapes.   Still, consider what it is doing.  A banana vs. a chocolate candy bar for some 4pm hunger  -- the banana wins.  It's heavier, healthier, sweet, and creamy.  It's 100 calories or so vs. the 250 calorie candy bar.  \n\n> Does that mean that a meal that consists of, for example, chicken breast and vegetables would be very filling and make you feel full, even if the portion is relatively small? \n\nPortions matter.  In working through dietetics, we have to look at both.  \n\nBut I would also say to consider the humble chicken thigh.   It's a few more calories, from fat, but will take you longer and the thigh tastes better and is less dry.",

Try to make it a habit of working out three times per week and slowly build up the intensity and frequency. When you feel ready, you could try going to the gym as well. I highly recommend going on walks too! Walking has so many positive benefits even when you take weight loss out of the picture. \n\nYou got this! I wish you luck :)",
                "This is not meant to be harsh, rather it\u2019s meant to make it as simple as possible:  eat less, walk more, start now.  \n\nThat\u2019s it.\n\nBuild on this.\n\nGo a bit further each day.\n\nYou\u2019ll get there.",

It's low impact and burns good calories, and if you find a good route and pop a podcast or audiobook on its honestly like therapy on some days!\n\nFood wise, calorie counting is the best way, but again it's about being conscious of what you're trying to do and not letting your experiences of the past ruin your chances. Your family got it ALL wrong, despite their methods being some of the methods you're going to try here - just consciously remember that YOU'RE making the choice to do it for you, and if you hit a wall and binge or have a bad day, guess what? It doesn't matter! Just make healthier choices but don't starve yourself and don't make food the enemy, you can still totally enjoy your food, just get your body moving so you can burn more of it.",

Legumes are very good for both protein and nutritional density. Because they are so healthy and offer basically everything your body needs, they also quell your appetite. Tofu in particular is very satiating, but you will need to prepare it well and in accordance with your tastes. Also, remember to drink a lot of water always, build up your confidence, and sleep long and early every day.\n\nGo get them! (I don't really know who \"they\" are, but get them anyway.)",

I wasn't overweight as a kid, but since my teenage years I always was super unfit. A bit embarrassing to admit, but took me till my mid twenties to realize that being unfit wasn't something that was inherent to my body but something I could change by starting to exercise. So I know what it feels like to hate working out, because I was just always so bad at everything and it was so hard/impossible (I am talking to you, push-up). But then I realized that there are a million things you can do as exercise. I didn't have to run or go to the gym. I can play badminton or table tennis or something else I enjoy. Took me some trying to find something that I really enjoyed, but once I did, it wasn't exercise anymore but my new hobby.

Instead of going from the current state back into something that reminds you of your childhood, maybe try something more fun and gentle.\n\nFor food: you could try to get more veggies and fruits in at every meal and learn to cook different dishes with more produce. I love spending a chill morning or afternoon in the kitchen making a big veggie curry or soup. It\u2019s kind of relaxing too. \n\nThat way you could start not by counting calories, but just trying to make an improvement in quality.\n\nFor exercise: it\u2019s important to find a kind of exercise you like.

            "responses": [
                "Hey there. \n\nJust an FYI those smart scales are not very good at doing what the claim. They are not good at accurately measuring body fat muscle mass ect and sometimes the estimate is just based on your total weight. As you have lost weight (well done btw) it's likely just estimating less muscle mass.\n\n I wouldn't worry about it, it sounds like you are employing healthy habits use the smart scales as an interesting addition to your routine but take the results with a pinch of salt. For example my smart scales told me my bone mass had dropped 10kg over night once, after checking I hadn't lost a leg in my sleep I did some research about how good they are. \n\nYou are training in quite a heavy deficit, if you want to ensure you are gaining muscle mass make sure your diet is protein rich and maybe consider reducing the deficit slightly. Remember to include an estimate of calories burnt in the gym as part of that calculation too.",
                "Smart scales are very inaccurate. Focus on losing weight by averaging each day per week. Daily fluctuations are very normal. Try to be patient and focus on the weight only and how you look in the mirror.",
                "Those scales have a pretty big margin of error so high that I'm not sure if they are of any use. What may have happened is you probably lost a lot of water weight which is pretty normal at the beginning and that can temporarily lead to a higher fat % but that does not mean you have a higher fat mass. \n\nStrength training and protein consumption slows down the loss of muscle mass, if you stick with your program over time you will keep losing fat mass much faster than muscle mass so don't worry about the first 1-2 weeks as measurements might fluctuate due to water.\n\nAlso you should track your cheat calories because it is possible to eat all the deficit back. Which is a mistake I made a lot. It can be demoralizing to eat 6 days worth of deficit in one sitting.",
                "As everyone has said smart scales are dubious at best.\n\nThe other culprit could be your protein intake. you need around .75-1 gram per lbs of ideal body weight for successful body recomposition . IE if your ideal is 140lbs you need around 105-140g of protein a day. I stay to the higher end of that because I noticed for me personally I start losing muscle if I dip below 120.\n\nAlso I get dexa scans which are pretty costly but far more accurate. I only do this every few months though.",
                "1450 calories sounds way too low for 107kg. Check your numbers again, but nothing strips muscle like being in too much of a deficit. You will also find your workouts are meh if you don't fuel them with enough carbs. So have a look at the calories and I would imagine something like 1800 might be closer.\n\nAlso make sure you are getting 150-200g protein per day and the best sleep you can, this massively helps with preventing muscle loss.",
                "My smart scale is inaccurate, we are a similar weight, and when I cut my cals hard I always get softer, that\u2019s part of cutting, so to combat that strength training really helps balance that out",
                "Smart scales can be not so smart sometimes. They use electrical impedance to estimate body fat and muscle mass, which can be affected by things like hydration, when you last ate, or even the time of day. So those small changes you're seeing? They might just be noise in the data. Also, you mentioned you're eating at a calorie deficit, which is great for weight loss. However, going from 5000+ calories to 1450 is a pretty dramatic drop. Your body might be a bit shocked by that change.\n\nThis app [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.winnovia.fitnessmath](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.winnovia.fitnessmath) can really help you out:\n\n1. Use the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) calculator to figure out how many calories your body needs just to function.\n2. Then, use the Daily Calorie Needs calculator to factor in your activity level. This will give you a more accurate picture of how many calories you should be eating.\n3. The Body Fat Percentage calculator can give you another estimate to compare with your scale's readings.\n4. Use the Daily Protein Intake calculator to make sure you're getting enough protein. When you're losing weight, protein helps preserve muscle mass.",
                "What everybody is saying is true those scale aren\u2019t that accurate, but if i could add one thing, try to increase your protein intake and reduce your carbs, you need protein to preserve/build your muscle mass",
                "Ask a bodybuilder, they'll tell you all about losing fat in a deficit without losing lean mass. In short, it's simply not possible. Even with the best and most balanced muscle stimulation, in a deficit, you'll lose some lean mass, too.",
                "My smart scale will tell me I lost 20lbs of muscle overnight sometimes(I am a big guy and have been lifting a long time so I do have a lot of lean body mass, so my scale usually reads 175-195lbs lean body mass). Looking at the average trends can be helpful, but always look at those number with skepticism. The weight is the only really accurate measurement on your scale. If you take measurements with a tape measure and body caliper you could get a more accurate body composition measurement at home, but you can also just trust the process and look at the numbers your scale gives you for fun.\n\nGoing from 53.6-52.8 is nothing, even if your scale was perfectly accurate maybe your muscles just have less glycogen and water in them.",
                "Honestly I feel like smart scales are a bit fraudulent. Like if I lost 2 kg in 2 weeks my scale will also tell me I lost bone mass. My weight has fluctuated a lot over the years and I have records of what my body fat % was at each weight thanks to the smart scale, but I also know from pictures and measurements that my 75kg when I was training for a 10k run looked quite different to my 75kg 2 years later when I was being a couch potato. The smart scale however claims I magically had the same muscle mass and body fat %.\u00a0\nIt's also heavily impacted by how much water retention you have, so if you are on your period it will tell you you have gained fat even though it's clearly water retention.\u00a0\nBasically, ignore the smart scale measurements they are not reliable. Use photos, measurements, clothes fit and fitness & mental health milestones instead to judge your success.",
                "Smart scales arent all that smart\n\nThat said, when you are eating in a calorie deficit, even if you are doing all you can to preserve/build muscle mass, it is inevitable that you will lose some muscle mass.  Even experienced body builders usually go through separate cycles of bulking (gaining weight/muscle mass, where they likely put on some fat as well), followed by a cutting cycle.",
                "I use my smart scale only for automatically connecting to my phone for weight tracking. All the extra numbers it spits out are meaningless. Tbh I only got the smart scale because it came with a Bluetooth measuring tape to automatically log my measurements. If not for that I'd have stuck with the dumb scale.",
                "Sounds like you need more protein. Aim for 1g per pound for goal weight. So if your goal is 130lbs, your goal is 130g protein. Protein is essential for muscle repair and growth. If you aren\u2019t getting enough, that could be why.  Being well hydrated and weighing at the same time(in the morning after your first bathroom visit/bowel movement) but before eating is ideal for consistency in measurements.",

Yes, obese people will lose muscle in a cut if they don't do resistance training and eat protein simply because their legs and core won't be worked as hard due to have less weight to move. However a true beginner to resistance training will have newbie gains, which will likely offset most/all of the muscle loss.",

But you are more likely to lose muscle, it's going to suck a lot more, and there's a higher chance you will quit before reaching your goal, or fall into old habits once you reach your goal.\n\nSo keep all that in mind. I've done extreme weight loss to get where I am now but no question that it's dangerous. So be careful. I'm working my ass off now to gain back the muscle I lost from hardcore weight loss and it's really hard.\n\nOr, look at your numbers again and consider a safer slower pathway.

Twice a week with good sleep is not a bad amount. You can always do more if you want. The gains come easiest when you're exercising a muscle for the first time.

Building muscle with that year's work will help you towards the caloric deficit you need.\n\n\nI don't know what scale is measuring your visceral fat but one point lower sounds like progress.

                "I think you still are doing too much. It takes time to get used to things.\n\nI lost almost 100 lbs, the project took 1 year, I have not even started calorie deficit until month 3. I already had experience of losing similar amount of weight and regaining it back over the next decade and I decided I don't want to repeat it ever again. So this time I wanted to do it right and make it stick and I started by figuring out how to do it, how to learn habits, etc.\n\nMonth 1 was adding daily activity (daily brisk walks, switching from large shopping run on weekend to daily walks to the grocery and jogging twice a week). I also started reading books about habit formation. I also dropped sugar from my diet.\n\nMonth 2 was starting to build some habits.  The first one was to just buy and eat a portion of fresh fruit every day. My long term goal was to change how I deal with food but I wanted to start not by reinventing the whole thing but rather by slowly displacing bad habits with good ones.\n\nMonth 3 was finally when I started cutting calories, shortening my eating window, ensuring that I have enough protein in my diet, etc.\n\nI don't think a week is enough to build a lasting habit of any kind. Give yourself more time.\n\nIf you feel overwhelmed, that's a sure sign you need to slow down a bit.\n\nI think it is better to do it slower and maximise your chances of sticking to it. Ideally, you would feel that you are hungry to do a bit more but you are stopping yourself from going overboard because you know this could cause burnout and it is better to be continuously feeling wanting to do more.",
                ">This is week 4 and I have 3 days left, counting today.\n\n>I am a panicking, because I feel like I am about to deviate from my course, like so many times before.\n\nThis pattern is really common, though most people skip the panicking. Think of all the new years resolutions that don't make it into Feb. This isn't a *you* problem, this is a *being human* problem.\n\nShort term, from a couple of days to a few weeks we can run on motivation. Long term, from a couple of months onwards, we run on habit, routine, enjoyment, and making the right choice the easy choice. In between is this gap where things are still hard, but we don't care as much.\n\nYou're mostly doing the right things, though by the numbers you're actually pushing yourself fairly hard in phase one. Aiming for 1kg a week fat loss is a lot, possibly too much for you. Focus on the tracking, even when you make a mistake or over-eat. A day when you eat 3000 cal but still track both builds the habit of tracking and gives you some useful info to reflect on. If that happens don't fix it, or beat yourself up, reflect and respect yourself for keeping the new skill going even when its hard.\n\nI'd also let yourself question the 1,500 cal target you've set. You're going to need to when you start adding resistance training anyway, and again in step 3 when you're thinking about your macros. Raising it to 2000 cal/day to make things a bit easier while you drill having any deficit and tracking would be fine. Our default plan has you spend a while tracking without a target for a while because it's a skill and habit that needs its own work. Maybe treat \"track everything\" as step 0, which you can fall back to if you need to without completely coming off plan.",

So zero exercise helps me control what I eat.\n\nAlso completely cutting out sugar is not realistically sustainable for me either. I\u2019m going to eat sugar.

I was very unhappy but did very little to address it. I was still active to a point, walking, cycling, swimming, hiking etc but still I loved BAD food too much, eating too many sweet treats, too big of a portion and not really caring.\n\nOver the last year I have been hard at changing my relationship with food, ensuring I was in a calorie defcit while still ensuring I ate properly. Swapping out foods for alternatives, making as many meals as I can from raw ingredients and ensuring I exercised. At first it was walking more which led to cycling more. Drinking plenty of water and sugar free drinks; eating dates for a sweet hit and turning back to full fat milk and real butter (after having read\u00a0[Ultra-Processed People: Why Do We All Eat Stuff That Isn\u2019t Food \u2026 and Why Can\u2019t We Stop?](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ultra-Processed-People-Stuff-That-Isnt/dp/1529900050)) which taught me alot.\n\nThis morning when I stood on the scales they read 90kg (198lbs)... and I cried.

It's an eating disorder I have, I even know now it will be with me the rest of my life and it will always be a battle. I can still eat stupidly if I wanted to (and have done recently) and the notion that \"your stomach shrinks so you cant eat as much\" for me is rubbish I can put food away inside me no issue but I have to choose not to.\n\nI have another 5kg to loose until I get to my goal \"fat\" weight and once I reach that I will stop thinking about the scales and instead turn to trying to tone my body up as much as I can which will obviously increase my weight but at least it will be muscle and then I will have to have excess skin removed as that will not vanish on it's own but I will wear those scars with pride that I was able to shift the food monster off my back.\n\nFor all of you out there struggling, take a breath, tomorrow is a new day, do what you need to do to get back on the weightloss wagon and remember only you can be the best you can be and never be upset if its not going completely how you want.

                "> Would anyone recommend anything included but not limited to colon broom or other shake mixes like that in order to help lose weight? \n\nNo, the opposite is my recommendation.  Your weight problems are most-likely (but not always) lifestyle problems and habit problems involving food and eating.   Work on those by staying on those -- don't distract yourself with products and \"dieting\" -- but by using your own foods and eating environment and scenarios to lose weight and keep it off.  \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/quick_start_guide\n\nThat's the method to start. Follow that guide and that timing, using your regular and normal food, and using portion control as your main tool for change. In later weeks, use the data to figure out if any foods need to be adjusted. All foods can fit, but sometimes we have to juggle or learn a new way to make an old favorite.\n\n> Do they actually work?\n\nIf they work, it's only temporarily.  When you \"go back to normal\" with your eating, then your weight goes back to normal, too.  Your normal eating supports your weight.   That's why to work on the portions, patterns, and some of the preparations involved in your eating -- tune and tweak, not overhaul -- using the data as your guide to lose the weight and then to keep it off.\n\n> Also why is it that I eat a bunch of protein and still feel hungry after?\n\nIt was a good idea -- protein and fat does have long-term satiety effects.  But neither answers short-term, right-now, hunger very fast (carbs do that).  So a balanced and adequate meal of roughly 50% calories from carbs, and 50% from proteins and fats can both answer our hunger within about 20 minutes and keep us until our next meal.\n\nThere is also a chance that your hunger is more like craving.  When we're generally hungry, we're needing a meal -- any meal -- pretty soon.   When we're craving, it's usually a craving FOR something specific -- an exact food or kind of food.   Cravings are not hunger but they're also not voluntary, and sometimes navigation of them needs some creativity.  \n\nWhat is the situation with your hunger?",

Make sure you average weekly weight and compare those numbers as it takes in consideration the daily fluctuation. If that average weight doesn't change let's say 2 weeks in a row review what can you on the caloric deficit side (eating even less food/swapping some higher caloric dense food for less caloric dense food) and/or increasing your activities.

                "Congratulations on the weight lost so far! Is losing 10 pound in 12 weeks achievable.. it depends. Like most things, the last 10% takes 90% of the time/effort. How long have you been in a diet phase? Typically 12 weeks of fat loss should be followed by 8-12 weeks of maintenance just to get rid of all the accumulated stress of being in a caloric deficit. If that meets your timeline right now, then it is definitely doable. If not, it might be better to give yourself some time to reduce the diet fatigue.\n\nYou already know this, given your awesome success already: if you are not losing fat, you need to choose whether to add more exercise or reduce caloric intake.\n\nYou mention lifting regularly, and so you may not be able to benefit as much from recomp strategies, honestly.

Other me really, and yea, my total consumed is between 1600-2200, normally on the lower side. And no weekends free, I never was a breakfast guy, so I normally have black coffee, and then a small snack around noon, slightly larger meal if I\u2019ve been cycling that morning. And if I eat at a restaurant I normally check to see if there\u2019s a cal count on the menu or ask if they have the time",
                "So the scale would help a lot. I didn't double check your stats but if your average is closer to 2200 and you are off with measuring cups it'll make a huge difference if you eating calorie dense foods, chips, nuts, peanut butter etc. You could easily hit 2800. Sometimes people have systematic issues, like using raw chicken calories for cooked weight or a bad database entry for another food. Or partner cooks with double the oil they think they do. Or using spray oil and logging zero calories. When there is a systemic error you just just drop calories by 200 till you lose weight and then find your maintained calories for your logging accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing i do with large fluctuations is look at high weights, so my highest weight from april is above my current highest weight for August so that helps me find progress if day to day is swinging hard. I lost 3 lbs last month but it would be totally hidden except I haven't seen my high weight from July again.\n\n\n\nHunger is only a good judge if you are eating mostly whole foods with light density and fiber. If you are starving on that then it can be a good indication of a calorie deficit. I can eat 2500 in pizza and still be hungry, so for me and a lot of other people processed foods have poor hunger control.\n\n\n\nAnother pitfall is that what a restaurant lists is whatever they measured and may not even be close to the actual calories the cook uses in terms of oils and stuff. So if someone eats primarily restaurant then their calories can be way under estimated.\n\n\nAt the end of the day, if all the common metabolic problems have been eliminated by a doctor all you can do it be consistent and keep dropping the calories. Tdee values are just estimates and can be wildly off. You could also up your accuracy by using a food scale or swap to less calorie dense foods so measuring errors aren't as bad.\u00a0"

I'm not sure what to do.\"\n\nYeah, you are in maintenance, not a plateau.\n\nDropping excessive soda and candy is all good nutritionally, but that doesn't usually reduce daily calories because you just replace those calories by eating more of the better foods.\n\nI don't know if this is your first time dieting, but creating a deficit (eating less) is generally uncomfortable. Maybe not all the time, but often much of the time. Obviously, you get hungry before meals, but I often get hungry at night. As far as the brain fog, I don't cut sugar entirely out. In fact, in the morning I drink 8 oz Gatorade (sugar) before and after my 2 hr workout. In terms of Pepsi, that would be about 1 can. Actually, if I am out of gatorade I would use Pepsi instead, but I rather used Gatorade for the electrolytes. I also keep sufficient carbs in my diet.

But I really hate my fat body, and having a roommate this summer who used a CPAP machine because she was 320 pounds really scared me into losing weight.

Your mother sounds like a terror. Threatening to cut you off from a lifeline like healthcare, calling your daughter a disgusting pig and fat shaming is clearly not great behaviour. It's fine for mothers to be concerned about their children's health, but this is just outright emotional abuse on your mothers part.\n\nAre you in therapy at all?

Losing weight under threat or pressure doesn't make it any easier.  In fact, it's likely to induce stress and anxiety, and that will promote a lower metabolism and slower weight loss. \n\nI would make it a vision to lose or maintain weight each month.  Some weeks will be up and some down, but the zig-zaggy line should stay in overall decline month after month.     A vision without a plan is just a wish, however, so you need a plan.  \n\nWhat is it that you'll actually do, each week?   Losing weight is something that our body does.  What is it that we do?  (Things like keeping a food diary, making time and tracking 150-300 weekly minutes of added physical activity atop of student life, seeing your doctor every X weeks for health checks.)   Make your plan, and ask yourself what are evidences and the artifacts of doing those things?  \n\nWe can't ever assure the outcome.  I couldn't tell you on July 9th 2014 when I was 298 that I would be 195 on July 9th 2015.   All I could do is the daily and weekly work towards that.  I had logs of my food and my walking.  I saw my doctor every 3-4 months, getting my blood tested to make sure my nutrition and lipids and blood sugar (I had diabetes) was okay.  \n\nIf you do lose your health insurance, you be ready.

It's hard to say but particularly for your weight/height I honestly think 1 pound (max 2 in some weeks) is a reasonable and healthy pace to lose weight. So 5 pounds every month is reasonable but likely when you get closer to 140-150lbs it will be harder to lose weight at that pace because you just have less body fat on you. Have you done a loose reading (via a digital/smart scale) on your body fat mass or body fat %? What is that number? I ask this because BMI honestly is not a very useful numbers. People that are muscular or people that are fat can have similar BMIs. So knowing your body fat and muscle mass are more meaningful measurements.

                "\"Is 5 lbs/month of weight-loss too quick after losing 27 pounds in the past 3 months?\"\n\nYou can lose 1% of your bodyweight per week, so, when you were 187, that would be 1.87 per week, and there are 4.3 weeks in a month, and that would be 8 lbs a month, and your 27 pounds you just lost was a bit faster than that.\n\nGoing forward, you can lose 1.5 lbs a week (at your current weight) which is 6.45 lbs a month.\n\nThus, 5 lbs a month going forward is pretty safe.\n\n\"Granted I started off weight-loss pretty unhealthily (only ate 1200 calories a day for the whole summer while working out for 3 hours a day)\"\n\nYour caloric intake and loss rate were within guidelines and not unhealthy. You did do it at the max rate but also with exercise, which is the best way to make it healthy and sustainable.\n\n\"but I want to make weight loss sustainable. My ultimate goal weight is 130 pounds (which is a BMI of 21 at my height).\"\n\nHow fast you lose the weight doesn't make it sustainable or not. If you try to go too fast and quit the diet, that isn't sustainable of course, but if you actually make it through the diet, how fast you did that isn't what allows you to keep the weight off. Getting sufficient exercise after you have lost the weight is what makes it sustainable or not.\n\n\"I really wish I could stop losing weight or obsessing over calories since statistically, 99% of people who were fat as teens are going to be fat as adults.\"\n\nI am not trying to tell you what kind of body you should have, but this statement is false. 30 years ago, there were far fewer overweight and obese teens. Obese teens were rare actually. We know that the majority of this childhood obesity epidemic is due to a rapid reduction in physical activity in children in the last couple of generations. Even though adult lives were gradually becoming more and more sedentary since the 1950's, children and teens were relatively unscathed. Something started in the 80's and 90's, and it went fast. Between the removal of real PE from schools and the change in leisure from outdoors on bicycles to indoors on iPhones, children and teens went from a generation of high energy to a generation of no energy almost overnight. Parents started keeping their kids indoors, and wouldn't let them walk anywhere on their own, unless it was only a few houses away.\n\nMy point is, how can something that occured so suddenly and obviously had an environmental cause (lack of activity) and is reversable be the end of the story for all these teens as you suggest? People are catching on to the physical activity side of this finally. The ACSM only just updated their recommendations 5 years ago. So even though it seems that once fat always fat, that is actually changing. It's just so new and predictions such as yours don't really apply to something that has just happened.\n\nI am not sure if your mother is just trying to push you or is going too far, or is just cruel, lol.\n\nYou did a fantastic job losing 27 lbs, and at 160 you are now in a new category. You can maintain 160 for the rest of your life. Had you stayed at 187, it would have just gotten worse as time went on. It is just that the extra weight makes sufficient activity even more improbable, which causes more weight, etc.\n\nBut at 160, you are back in the safe zone, as long as you stay active.\n\nAnyways...\n\n5 lbs a month isn't over the top. It also isn't super easy. If you are having issues with this rate then you need to speak up to your mom. You need to tell her that you want to continue this journey, but you are having issues with the rate of loss she is demanding. Tell her that you don't want to lose what you have done and gain it all back, because you tried to go too fast, and caved.\n\nAsk her if 1/2 lb a week is ok? round it to 3 lbs a month. I mean only if you want to go further. You are now light enough to build and keep up with an effective weekly workout routine. With a solid consistent workout routine and a small 250 cal deficit, in less than a year, you won't even remember any of this fat stuff.:)",
                "TL;DR: 5 lbs per month is doable and safe. This of course doesn't mean is always doable, as life has a way of interfering with good plans and intentions. But is safe if you can bring the deficit.  \nA good weight loss rate is proportional to body weight. The lower you get, the slower you can lose.\n\n>I'm currently 5'6'' and 160 lbs.  \nIs 5 lbs/month of weight-loss too quick after\n\nI'm not going to comment much on the attitude your mother has. Maybe she is well-intended, maybe she has her good or bad reasons, and maybe you will even be thankful to her for the \"push\", someday,  but she is pretty awful. \n\nYou have a BMI of around 25, and \"want\" to go to 22 something. \n\nI guess that 1% body weight per week is doable but slightly on the fast side.\n\nThis means 1.5lb per week or 6 pounds per month. \n\nA 1lb per week, 0.7% body weight per week, or 4 lbs per month is not an issue.\n\nIf you would plan a weight loss diet, the range I would go is between 1lb and 1.5lbs per week to minimize muscle/lean mass loss. The 5 lbs per month is somewhere in the middle.\n\nOf course, in most cases, what looks good on paper, may look different in reality. Stress and life changes will decrease our ability to hold a deficit, and increase our appetite. Which is why I like ranges. Safety margins. Small goals.\n\nBut 5 lbs per month is not too fast.\n\nAnd I still believe your mother is awful, sorry."

Try out healthy recipes that you've never made before instead of trying to reduce the calories in recipes you made before weight-loss.\n\n2. Count calories more roughly. Notice how you feel. Do you feel a similar amount of fullness after each meal as when you were calorie counting strictly? Do you feel similar at the end of the day? Is your rate of weight loss keeping pace with before? If yes, you're still in a deficit. If no, maybe you need to back-track and count calories more strictly. \n\n3. Stop counting calories. By now you should know what a low-cal meal feels like and looks like. You should know what kinds of foods you should be eating and which you should have in moderation or not at all.

I feel like I\u2019m barely eating anything at all and I rarely eat anything I like anymore.\n\nYou can blame counting the calories as many people do, or you could dive deeper into the why like you already started to do.\n\nCalorie counting is just a way of providing transparency over how much energy you get. You hate the transparency. Almost everybody does. \n\nYou can't argue with the food app, and just because you feel like you should be eating more, the app doesn't change the value. Which is why is such a good method. All it does is to show you how much you eat. \n\nYou are fighting yourself right now, which BTW, is quite normal. This is what makes diets hard. You see you should eat less, but the calorie counting is making you feel bad, is your Jiminy. \n\nSo is important to understand that food needs arise, for modern humans, mostly from our emotional and hedonistic needs.\n\nGain control of emotional eating [https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/weight-loss/art-20047342](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/weight-loss/art-20047342)\n\nIs also important to know, that you could change this.\n\n[Disenchant Your Bad Habits](https://www.artofmanliness.com/featured/disenchant-your-bad-habits/)\n\nAnd maybe helpful, if it feels hard, then relax, take a \"break\", and keep tracking your calories but without focusing on losing weight. \n\nDon't avoid foods you like, don'T change your dietary composition. Just track first. Then slowly, try to lower the amount of food you eat. Maybe a burger less per week, and a salad more. Or whatever works for you.\n\nYou can have your burger and lose weight. But maybe not every day.",
                "It doesn't sound like you hate tracking. It sounds like you hate having to be accountable for what you're eating, because you'd rather not know so that you don't have to feel bad about it.\n\nI get it, I feel the same way a lot of the time.\n\nIntermittent fasting would be great for you. If you don't eat breakfast and lunch, for example, your dinner can be very calorie dense.",

                "don't sweat it - it's definitely difficult. there are people that can just switch their mindset to \"I'm eating chicken/rice/broccoli and 1800 calories now\" instantly and adhere to it indefinitely.\n\nFor the rest of us, it takes a while to figure out enough meals that will satiate our need for variety, be fast to prepare, be convenient, keep us full for long enough etc.\n\nIt also takes a while for your digestive system and your palate to adjust to changing your diet and to get used to new tastes. I could not stand kale a few years ago, nowadays I crave it.\n\nIf you actually like food and like a variety of food (so you like eating and you can't really eat the same thing day in day out) you will most likely have a more difficult time than a person that can just turn on the mindset I mentioned before.\n\nThere's also a big difference between \"starving\" and \"craving\". Hunger is really not that bad, and after 10-15 minutes, and we can often mistake thirst for hunger so make sure you are sufficiently hydrated.\n\nCravings are psychologically much harder to deal with and the reality is you will need to practice fighting those cravings if you really want to reduce sugar/hyper palatable food.",

My advice is add things in - so if you\u2019re eating a full fat tuna sandwich, add in some carrot sticks on the side. Or if you want some chips, make a snack plate with a few chips, and add some sliced turkey, light string cheese, and a piece of fruit. This way you eat what you want and what you need. I\u2019ve been making little snack plates with the thing I want, and then adding a little bowl of fruit, some light cheese, hummus, etc. and it\u2019s helped me not obsess and feel like I\u2019ve balanced things. I\u2019ve yo-yoed a lot with my weight in my life and this is the first time I\u2019ve lost weight without counting calories and without starving myself. I hope this helps on your journey!"

                "Note I said \"they like food in a similar way\". The key factor in obesity is using food to cope with emotions. You feel bored, you eat. You are sad, you eat. And so on.

In presence of an abundance of calories, you gain weight and this eating behaviour gets reinforced.\n\n>\u00a0that it's possible a recent ancestor had gone through extreme duress or a famine\n\nIt's called epigenetic, and probably refers the Dutch Winter research. Again, there are factors, and there is impact. Impact is small. Like mentioned, this line of research, which is indeed quite interested was kicked by the famine that the Netherlands experienced at the end of the WW2. It showed that children born during and after this event, to people that experienced the famine, had a higher risk to obesity. \n\nThe Netherlands obesity rate is 16%. Less than half of the obesity rate in the USA. \n\nBecause again, Epigenetics has a small impact compared to environmental factors. Big enough to be statistical significant.\n\nGenetic and Epigenetics do not determine your weight. Your weight is determined by your lifestyle. Genetical and epigenetic factors may have an influence on your behaviour, make it more likely for you to like food. But even this influence falls almost complete in the typical human variation. That's it.  \n\nA huge part of the population in Europe and Asia has a recent history of famine during WW2 and sometimes after it. USA doesn't. Which areas have a higher obesity rate? \n\nThinking, that the reasons for your weight are outside of your reach, like genetics, is pretty much a textbook self-fulfilling prophecy. Is basically fat acceptance textbook.\n\nWe live in an obesogenic environment. We use the abundance of food to feel better. Those are the reasons for our weight. You can change the environment around you and you can change your eating and exercise behaviour.",
                ">Science isnt close to answering the question how much of obesity in modern society is attributable to genetics.\n\nStrange, because it has to be. \n\nWe have identified a significant amount of genes, that have an impact on **appetite** and obesity. Genes like FTO (Fat mass and obesity associated protein). This is why scientists say that genetics play a role. \n\nAnd we can look at the model population, at FTO or more genes (Obesity Score), see what is the association between a gene variant in the population and that person weight and what is the likelihood of obesity or normal BMI for people having a bad obesity score or a good one. \n\nAnd we see that the likelihood differs little, and that people with the worse obesity score have similar chances of normal BMIs to people with a good obesity score.\n\nWhich is not surprising because the human genes did not changed that much over two or three generations and while we have seen an shift in BMI since the begining of the 20th century, obesity epidemic is a new phenomenon. \n\nAnd what we see is a shift in the whole population, with small individual differences, because of the gene addressed.\n\nWe all \"respond\" to the environment by gaining weight. Some slightly more, some slightly less.\n\nSo I can't dismiss the majority of the scientists just because somebody doesn't like the result. \n\nI will dismiss any \"scientist\" claiming than genes makes people fat and they can't change a thing. Because is observable false.\n\nBy now we know that obesity is not a diseases **determined** by genetics, and that there are much bigger (by impact) environmental and behavioural **factors** modulating the risk. \n\nWhich is important, because in those factors is where the solution lies, for each of us. We chan't change the genes we always had.

There are many dance and pilates workouts... people like Madfit, Blogilates, Chloe Ting....\n\n\nRemember, the weightloss is mainly due to dietary changes though. The amount of skin tighting depends mostly on genetics not on how fast you've lost the weight. When you loose rapidly, it first may look bad but skin needs months/1year to tighten up a bit again. When you loose slowly you'll just notice this less.\u00a0",
                "Do things that you enjoy.  You're not enjoying this.  I suspect, but can't be sure, that the part giving you so much trouble is this:\n\n> I\u2019m trying to push myself. It\u2019s not always the coaches trying to bump up my level, sometimes I volunteer.\n\nThe best fitness advice that I ever got didn't come from school or the military, it came from here from someone who helped me as I was starting to jog again.   \"Start so deliberately slowly, so gently, that you're sure you are wasting your time.  Then, let your nature pull you forward.  You'll have good form. You'll become faster without sacrificing safety and enjoyment.\"    \n\nI did that.  Within 3 months, I was running 5K in 30 minutes, from nothing.   \n\n> I\u2019ve read neither will help me reach my goals of building muscle and getting fit. \n\nPerhaps instead of thinking of these as destinations, think of these as compass headings.  Stronger (than now).  Fitter (than now).    If this is going to be a lifetime habit, then there is no date by which we expect to be fit and stop.  The deeds themselves are right to do, and fitness is the side-effect of them.   \n\nBecause it's so long-term, our enjoyment of them is paramount.  Loving it is what makes the difference between an exercise that we do 150\u2013200 times yearly because we love it and one we force ourselves to do 50\u2013100 times because it's a chore or a bore.    Don't like it?  Switch it.  \n\n> I\u2019m ashamed that I\u2019m a failure. \n\nYou're not expected to be a saint.   You're not a fallen-saint.  It helps me to think of myself as a student -- I enrolled as someone without these skills, and I'm here to learn them.     As long as we don't quit working on it, then failure is our teacher.   The only two possibly outcomes from trying are winning, or learning more about how to win.",

But because I used to run in high school I thought for the longest time that Running was MY way to stay healthy. And then I was disappointed in myself every time I ended up quitting again, which Upon reflection was usually done because of my feet. \n\nThis go around I\u2019ve started swimming. I\u2019m really fortunate to have a gym with an indoor pool nearby, and I know that isn\u2019t feasible for everyone but my answer isn\u2019t \u201cJust try swimming!\u201d I\u2019m telling you I started swimming because by happy logical coincidence, I FOUND my exercise! It doesn\u2019t hurt my feet! I feel like I can stick with it! I\u2019ve seen myself make progress! \n\nAnd I want the same for you. You deserve it! The workout bringing you to tears, or where you\u2019re never progressing is not the workout for you. It\u2019s better to do a workout that feels like \u201cme\u201d time than the one the internet says is going to give you the dream composition you\u2019ve seen in magazines. \n\nDon\u2019t cry anymore.

                "A big part of creating sustainable change is making it so that you enjoy what you are doing.

                "Outside of what people have already said there are two things I'd consider from what I've read, are you eating enough protein to actually create gains and what are you eating before you exercise? Having a meal with carbohydrates and protein one to three hours before an exercise makes sure your body will have easily available energy to actually perform.\n\nThe amount of calories you're eating also matter, if you're eating the bare minimum to not die any exercise you do isn't going to feel great.",
                "You are not a failure. This stuff IS hard, but there are hacks to get around that, don't worry.\n\nFrom your description, I get the impression that you are maybe not preparing your muscles for what they have to do? Experiencing muscle tension that wrecks your form and strength? Starting with too high weights/intensity? I tell you, one or more of these probably kill it.\n\nYou need to know something that sadly nobody ever tells you: Movement, just light movement, is necessary for muscle tissue to even get its nutrients. Without it, they'll be barely scraping by, and then you load weight on top, of course they are going to complain!\n\nWarm-up exercises like soft dynamic stretching are absolutely necessary. If, for example, you want to do a bench press, but your shoulders are immobile and all tensed up from long years of sitting and resting, you first need to move them around in all possible directions and angles, also with different positions of your neck (as you see, it's not 100 % trivial). This will allow the synovial fluid and blood to get in and nourish the muscle, fascial, cartilage and bone tissue. It's the most effective thing you can do to resolve debilitating muscle tension, and if necessary, you may be spending an entire gym session just with this form of rehabilitation.\n\nOnly work your muscles AFTER warming up in this way! When you actually start to feel your body. Only then will your muscles be able to work together well and you shall see: Your technique will improve!",

Also there are many things you can do at home for free. There are many videos on YouTube for instance. I think that you\u2019re wasting your money if you\u2019re not enjoying it or getting any benefit from it. As far as eating there\u2019s not any information provided to take say either way. To make this sustainable you need to find something that you enjoy doing in a regular basis. You said you enjoyed Pilates can you try to do that and see if that\u2019s something you still enjoy? You Are Not A Failure!!!! You just haven\u2019t found what will work best for you yet and that\u2019s okay. Please don\u2019t cry. You will find what you like and it will make all the difference to you. Try different things to rule out what you want to keep doing and what is a no. You do got this.

                "My advice, have you learned enough about form and the different lifts to do it on your own now? If so, find a less expensive gym and try it on your own without the trainer and see how that goes. You\u2019ll eventually have to do this anyway. \n\nI also want to add something opposite to what others are saying. There are people advising to switch to cardio, but your biggest desire is to avoid a deflated body after you lose weight, per your comment. To do that you will need to strength train. Cardio is not going to do that in the long run, especially if you are looking at major weight loss (and like me, you are older). \n\nYou need to build the lean muscle mass (not bulk, but still need muscle to fill out where the fat was). Cardio won\u2019t do that. Another issue with long term cardio is it will turn your body in to one that craves endurance vs strength. The impact on that is it will shed muscle instinctively, it will also lower your total daily calories. Muscle needs more calories to survive\u2026 so, in the long run you can eat more and keep a leaner body strength training vs cardio. \n\nAlso, the failure rates in keeping weight loss off are higher because cardio, at maintenance levels are harder to sustain. Yes it can be done, to the people doing it keep going. But keep in mind for OP, keeping a tight body at the end is a primary goal.",
                "Hi.\n\nYes, rapid weight loss is not good. The only two reasons I think to lose weight quickly is:\n\n1) If your obesity would literally endanger your life\n\n2) If you are the type of person that will not stick to a project unless you see quick progress on it (like me)\n\nThe main problem with rapid weight loss is loss of muscle. This is a huge issue, because that muscle mass is super important not only to move around, but to do other things. It serves as a main way for us to burn calories, buffers blood sugar, helps regulate a lot of other body processes.\n\n> I\u2019m not getting any better. I still get stuck on the same number of reps, struggle with the same exercises.\n\nThat's fine. That's not bad. Realise, while you are in weight loss it is going to be hard to build muscle and become stronger.\n\nBut here is the thing, you are not going there to build muscle. You are going there to **\\*preserve\\*** muscle. As long as you can keep doing the same exercises at the same reps and loads, it means you are not losing muscle mass and **guess what, that's fantastic news**.\n\nI suggest you change your thinking about it. You stick to doing it and I guarantee that as you keep losing weight at some point things will probably start moving in the great direction. For now, just the fact that you are able to keep doing the exercises is a great thing.\n\n> I\u2019m literally crying as I type all of this. I\u2019m at my wits end and I\u2019m ashamed that I\u2019m a failure.\n\nNope. **Sticking to your project is literally the opposite of failure.**\n\nThe only way to fail at it is to stop doing it.",

You can easily lose 1 lb per week with the right deficit.  \n\nI think it's good to stick with your exercise program and you could add some youtube videos on the other days to do at home.  Take a gentle approach on the non gym days. Try something like Senior Shape Fitness with is for beginners and is really relaxing to do while still incorporating movement.",

I went two times per week, sometimes three. I kept this up for about a year. I hated every single minute of it. I felt like I didn't make any progress at all. The weights never became lighter. Every rep was a chore and it was sooooo boring. I listened to podcasts and music during training, but nothing could convince my brain that whatever I was doing was fun or at least bearable. I also have ADHD, btw... After paying them a full year while not going I counted my losses and quit my membership. That was like 2 to 3 years ago.\nThis time around I joined a friend at indoor rock climbing and oh boy, was that a game changer. It's a full body workout. You can make it as difficult or easy as you like. Progress (albeit slow) was there from day 1. Figuring out how to do a route is a mini-puzzle that appeases my ADHD. It feels like I'm tricking my body into exercising. The first time I went I was sore for a week, but I was hooked."

I had reasons to believe that i was a bit lower than usual yesterday, plus i have super sore muscles today, so there's extra water. Had it not gone back up today, I would've gotten worried about losing too fast.\n\nI went to the gym yesterday which was great, food was so so, i gave in and had a few gummies in the afternoon. It wasn't a lot, i stayed within my calorie goal, but it was impulsive and could've been done with a healthy snack instead. No big deal, just not great.\n\nThis evening I'll go and watch a soccer match with my boyfriend.

I made a bad joke and apologized as soon as I realized it (all happened via chat because he is on vacation), I still feel bad for the joke.

I'd love to see the 88 just shortly before I hit my period. Lol. \n\n88 kg is my first target goal and now that I'm close I don't have the patience to wait until I reach it (somewhere in September). I'm thinking about where this journey will have taken me around Christmas... \n\nI am on a 1 kg deficit on loseit. So I think I should get down another 4 kg before Christmas if I stick to my deficit. I entered this as a goal into libra without changing my starting date or weight (June, 2 and 94.8 kg). It gave me a line a good bit above my actual line. So I thought, heck, this looks like I am really losing a bit more per months. Not way more, but you know, a little more. Looks like the not accounted exercise. \n\nSo now my new goal for December 24 is 84 kg. I also happen to like even numbers much more and despise 5s anyway, so that's much more pleasing. I mean, I'm happy to see ANYTHING below 88. 86 would be just as ok with me (but ask me again when I'm there. Lol). And I wouldn't mind weighing 85 however little I find the number pleasing. \n\nYou can see the summer is ending and my mind goes straight to Christmas. Haha. \n\nHowever, I almost met my calorie goal yesterday. I was a bit hungrier over the day then I liked. My mind wandered in the evening. And I found myself physically in front of the cupboard. I patted myself on the back and said, no, you're not gonna have anything anymore today. You've had enough. Go, drink some water and go to bed. And so I did.

Thank god I ate a salad for lunch as the rest of the day just fell off a cliff and I ate nothing but carbs and chicken. I at least reeled myself in to eat around 1700kcal, a healthy deficit for me. I think the wrench in my plan was my afternoon escapade into baking. I made these chicken and Gouda stuffed milk buns for the first time and I just cracked as soon as I brushed the tops of them with melted butter.. I restrained myself enough to split half of one with my husband at the very least. But it set off a chain reaction for the rest of the day. Fortunately I managed to stow those calorie-bombs into a freezer bag and get them out of my sight. \n\nToday I think things will go better. As per usual, 8k steps, stretch, <1800kcal, and aerobics.

I started lifting and doing BJJ around 6-8 months ago when I started I was around 115-120lbs.  I lift around 3-4 times a week and do bjj 2-3 times a week. I can tell I\u2019ve gained muscles and definitely more fat. I feel stronger and I want to continue to get stronger and have more muscles definition and be tone. I was thinking it\u2019s time to transition to a calorie deficit until I\u2019m like 140 and see how it is. I got the fitness pal app to track my macros. This is what is recommends: 1800 calories, 203g carbs, 113 G protein, 60g fat. I guess I was a bit confused why I would have high carbs? I also wanted to know some more tips and advice on being in a calorie deficit for time I feel like my body weight fluctuates a lot more as a woman and would like to know what it\u2019s like for other people thank you ! ",

                "It\u2019s awesome that you\u2019ve been lifting and doing BJJ for so long, you\u2019re making some serious progress! It\u2019s totally understandable to feel a bit confused about the carbs. Your body needs them for energy, especially with how active you are. As for the calorie deficit, it\u2019s great that you want to take things slow. Everyone\u2019s body is different, and it\u2019s okay for weight to fluctuate, especially with hormones and life in general. Stay patient with yourself, and remember that feeling strong and healthy is what really matters.",
                "So basically you\u2019d want to stay with 113 G protein and 60g fat, and just change the amount of carbs. More carbs when you gain, less carbs when you increase deficit. Try doing this for two weeks and adjust accordingly.",
                "The high carbs are probably to fuel your BJJ and lifting sessions, but you can always tweak your macros if you feel sluggish or not seeing the results you want. Just remember, its a marathon, not a sprint listen to your body, and dont stress too much over the numbers",
                "According to the Food and Drug Administration, the daily value for carbs is 275 grams (g) per day when eating a 2,000-calorie diet. So it sounds like it's just kept that stock standard value and scaled it down a bit to meet you weight loss per week goal.\n\nI use a different app that asks you what your goals are and then also you select from standard, ketogenic or low carb and I use the numbers from that in MyFitnessPal in the Nutrition Goals section. I selected low carb so mine's on 25% but you don't have to do low carb to lose weight, you just have to stay under the total, however you get there.",
                "Okay I\u2019m thinking of starting with that amount of carbs it just seemed like alor because I thought when losing weight you would want low carbs. Like not really eating potatoes or rice as much. And eating more whole veggies and fruits",

                ">I think that's a lost cause because I couldn't lose weight when I was fully functioning and working out 4 x a week, how can I lose now when I'm hardly moving? \n\nWeight loss is made in the kitchen, not the gym. Exercise is a great way to relieve stress, to improve fitness and health, but it's not an especially effective way to lose weight. I mean, even you noticed this:\n\n>I was going to they gym 4 days a week, working out hard for 1 - 1.5 Hours a day. Muscles grew, didn't lose weight but absolutely started getting healthier. A1C went down and I was Feeling better. \n\nBut to lose weight, you need to eat fewer calories than you burn. And that is much easier to accomplish when you are not eating food that is super dense with calories. \n\n>So fast food or quick food seems to be what we are eating. \n\nFast food and convenience foods are packed with fat, calories and salt. All the stuff that isn't great for your health or your waistline. \n\nLet me make one suggestion: when you fill your plate, fill 1/4 to 1/3 of it with vegetables. Frozen vegetables are convenient, less expensive and less work than fresh vegetables. You can steam them in the microwave with a few tablespoons of water, then toss with a little soy sauce.",
                "Can you go for lower calorie density ordered food, or work together to meal prep?",
                "I'm near enough bed bound and have lost 83.5lbs so far (still more to go). \n\n\nMy biggest suggestion would be either for husband to batch cook or to make lots of foods in a similar vein to stir frys, so that they can be quick but also easily made healthy.\n\n\nI have a limited amount of time I can stand for (about 2-3mins) so everything I do is done in short bursts. I'm on crutches when I ambulate, and I can't go very far or for very long. \n\n\nThe biggest helps to me have been figuring out recipes I can make in the microwave and especially stuff I can set going and walk away from it rather than needing to check on it. \n\n\nMy family and my carer help a ton by batch cooking portions of meat. I then use the microwave in my bedroom (I have basically a mini kitchen set up with a fridge/freezer and kitchen island- initially bought to help me support myself and then as my mobility improved it got used as an actual island too now). \n\n\nI rely on a lot of the \"part cooked\" frozen food. So, for example, frozen part cooked baked potatoes. That way, they don't take more than 5mins to cook and they don't need turning or checking to make sure they're done. I can just put it in a bowl on my scale, record the weight in my app and then chuck it in the microwave and set it going.\n\n\nThen the next time I get up a few hours later, I can cut it up and set the frozen microwaveable steam bag of veg going and again leave it going and add it to the potato later. \n\n\nI then another time I get up I cut up the precooked chicken that I've left to defrost overnight (we freeze all the portions of meat) and  add that to the bowl, then stock and seasoning and voila, that's my evening meal done. \n\n\nSo my main tips are batch cook, look for cheats that allow you to not have to keep checking something, do stuff in stages, small tasks that don't keep you upright for long and finally:\n\n\nIf you can, using a cheap food scale and a tracking app on your phone (I use cronometer, I've seen other recommendations of myfitnesspal or the lose it app and there are others too). \n\n\nIf you don't know what you need to be eating then using something like tdeecalculator.net or sailrabbit.com/bmr/ can give you an estimate of your tdee (total daily energy expenditure), which is an estimate of how many calories you'd need per day to maintain your current weight at your current level of activity. \n\n\nIf you are still healing, I wouldn't suggest a big deficit, so maybe something in the 200-500kcal range deducted off your sedentary tdee estimate will be enough. Make sure to not go below 1200 for women or 1500kcal per day for men as it gets harder and harder to get adequate nutrition at or below those numbers. \n\nThere are absolutely other ways to lose the weight but this is just the most straightforward one I've done. You could overall try to reduce your portions or bulk your meals up with veg and salad while reducing the other parts of it. But it's worth keeping protein at a reasonable level while you're inactive and healing especially.\n\n\nThe guidelines I've seen suggested in the studies I've come across are:\n\n\n0.8-1.0g/kg/day- for people who aren't trying to actively gain muscle \n\n1.2-1.6g/kg/day for people who are actively trying to gain muscle. This is also mentioned in studies discussing trying to minimise muscle loss in hospitalised patients, so this is the one I aim for due to my situation. \n\n\n\nThis is a ton of info that may or may not help but if you have any questions or need any clarification please ask away. \n\n\nGood luck with the physio and everything else too.\n\n\nEdit: also, it's not wrong to have nice treats occasionally.  As long as you are considering them and not just nomming everything in sight, then it can easily fit into your weight loss plan. I have something sweet pretty often, my way to include it is to have small portions of it. So, for example, I have 1 or 2 small cookies as a treat or ill have a small portion of a chocolate bar (it's a dairy free thing cause I can't have cow or goat milk but I portion it and freeze it). \n\nI basically figured out all I want is the taste of the thing.  I don't need to have a massive portion of it to feel satisfied with having it. So I have enough for it to be enjoyable and it also is a small enough amount that it fits in my weight loss plans. \n\n\nI also occasionally have days where I just have additional stuff because it's a birthday or other special day. All it means is that week my weight loss will be slower, it doesn't drastically change anything having one day where I eat more. I do try to keep at or below maintenace but even if I go over every once in a while, all it changes is my rate of weight loss over that week or fortnight. It doesn't stop the progress that I'm making, just slows it down briefly.",

I can\u2019t recall exactly how I did it but I know I was ordering fresh direct (grocery delivery in my area) and choosing healthy options. Also if there are easy meals that don\u2019t require much cooking you could eat those, like fried eggs, heated up chicken sausage and microwaved frozen vegetables",

I was using whole milk with KRAVE Cereal and drinking it all. \n\nI mentioned in a previous reply that I plan on making a meal plan this weekend, going shopping.

The weight was lost in a not-so-healthy way, but i'm trying and succeeding with being better about my health and nourishing my body properly. While I look and feel way better, the amount of sag on my whole body frankly disgusts me. I've been heavier all my life and my mom always told me to lose the weight sooner rather than later as when you're younger your skin bounces back way more. I don't feel or see that at all, I have so much loose skin on my arms, stomach, and most begrudgingly, my boobs. I have a long term boyfriend for the very first time and I know he thinks I'm beautiful, but when I look in the mirror I don't understand why. I'm not tight and taught and fit like the other women my age I know he's been with, and it's so discouraging. My saggy loose skin makes me feel gross, and I'm a student and definitely can't afford surgery, even with \"free healthcare\" in Canada. When I was heavy I absolutely despised my body, but now I feel that same feeling, but for different reasons. Sometimes I think I should gain back weight so that I can be voluptuous and full again, but I know logically that I shouldn't. I went from a 42E/DDD to a 36D but my girls look so deflated and tragic. I want to be firm and tight like other 21 year olds. Does anyone have any tips for exercises, massage techniques or supplements to take that improve saggy deflated skin and give it back that bouncy fullness that I'm so missing??",

Acceptance is the key to serenity over things we can't control.

The water is being held there to repair the muscle tears you create when lifting (this is a good thing, it's how you grow muscles) but unfortunately, most of that 5lbs and that pump isn't actually muscle growth.

There is such a thing as panic disorder, where  the body learns to associate cues like an elevated heart rate exclusively with fear and can start a panic attack just off of physical triggers alone. The light headedness could be a symptom of building anxiety rather than of some physical issue.\n\nThis is often associated with other anxiety disorders such as agoraphobia, but can also develop on its own.

So I was cleared for launch.\n\nBut I did a lot of research on exercise and different modalities, walking, running, biking, treadmills, weights, etc.\n\nYou don't have to break 130 to have an effective workout program. 120 is actually effective, but the bottom end is probably 100 to 110, which is brisk walking. You will have to have longer sessions or more sessions to get enough active calories, but if 130 is your limit, that puts you in a good spot. 110 works, just you could need an hour to 90 minutes of activity at that HR. It depends though. You still might have activity in your daily life and not need as much \"exercise\".\n\nObviously being able to go past 130 has advantages. It takes me half the time to burn the same calories. I also get a lower resting HR. There are cardiovascular benefits.

Especially with running.\n\n**You should maybe not start with running, start with walking, increase the speed, and switch to walking and jogging.  In time, more jogging, less walking.**\n\nThis not only will build your aerobic capacity but is the best way to do it.

Years ago, still overweight, I used to hit this heart rate while walking.\n\nYour heart will not only hold but get better.\n\nJust take it easy. If you want to run, run as slow as you can. And then try slower. In the beginning that's the best and probably is not slow enough for the optimal training effect.\n\nThe second, cardio and intense resistance training needs carbs.

Hard to breathe, hard to move, and I had some strong discomfort in my pelvic floor\n\nWe talk a lot about building sustainable habits, and this is a recipe for something that you're going to find tough to maintain (repeated hard efforts will lead to injury or loss in motivation because you won't have energy). The absolute game changer for me was learning to run at a truly easy effort.\n\nAt your stage, that may even be just walking. To gage an easy effort, you should be able to (mostly) comfortably say the pledge of allegiance out loud (~50 syllables). You shouldn't be able to sing it but it shouldn't be incredibly difficult either.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would do the following [5k plan for walkers](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/5k-training/walkers-5k/). It's a great way to slowly build up that time on feet, and then I would probably transition to a couch 2 5k plan to introduce some running (again at an easy effort).\n\nEven the top professional runners run roughly 80% of their runs at this easy, conversational pace (though their easy pace is much faster than most people lol). By running at an easy effort, you give your body ample time to recover and it allows you to build a lot more mileage. I went from a 14:00 / mile for 1 mile to a 12:00 / mile for 5 miles from couch 2 5k (both of these at 175+bpm), and then from that to an 8:45 / mile for 10 miles (~158bpm) as my volume increased. Aiming for a 7:30 / mile half marathon this November :) I hope this was helpful and sorry that it's unsolicited advice. Best of luck on your journey!\n\nEdit: one other small tip you might find helpful; you may find it easier to set your runs up by time instead of distance (as shown in the 5k plan for walkers / couch 2 5k). The reason behind this is when you set a distance goal, many times people will speed up in the latter portion because they want to be done sooner. If you set a time limit like 20 minutes you'll naturally keep your effort easier because it doesn't matter how far you're going.",
                "I've lost 70lb and travelled more than 1000 miles on foot to achieve my goal. Not a single mile of those were jogging or running so you're ahead of me lol. I hike so pretty much every mile I've done is ~20 mins.",

I struggle with health stuff and just a lot of challenges in general and have been trying to start this journey for six months with constant failure to launch. I feel like I've finally hit a stride  very recently and here is what's been working for me: \n\nA walking pad: time is hard for me to carve out because I have a lot of responsibilities, so I've been using this walking pad to double up on computer stuff on a standing desk and exercise at the same time. Also I can zone out and watch tv while also causally walking and boom, 4 miles just passed somehow. And it is enough! Because now I split up the miles- I'll do a quick 15m mile several times a day when on the phone, randomly, when I wake up, after dinner and it's short bursts and doesn't feel tough, but damn I just walked six miles today and barely noticed.\n\nProtein bars: calorie counting is arduous and hard, and I can get obsessive over what I'm eating next. It has the opposite effect it should for me. Buying protein bars as a meal replacement kind of takes away all the guess work and is simple\n\nUpping protein: I see this a lot and I didn't believe anybody for whatever reason, but eating a lot of protein actually stopped me from being hungry and thinking of food a lot. Duh, everyone says it, ite a thing.  I don't want to deal with meat all day so I eat a lot of Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, protein bars, and I don't feel hungry very often anymore. \n\n\nIt's hard to believe it will get easier when you're in the starting stage but keep pushing through! Ppl say it gets easier and it does, just takes two or three weeks or so. You can do this! Small changes one at a time",

But what I'm asking for advice on is how to safely lose weight and find ways to exercise as a teenager. I'm a female, 5'5.5\" and 125 lbs the last time I checked, but it could be closer to 130 since it changes sometimes. I mainly want to lose weight for aesthetic/looks purposes, since I'm really unhappy with how big my legs are and I'd like a smaller/more defined waist. I don't have access to a gym and don't participate in any sports at school, because I never liked it and now that I'm older I simply do not have time for any other extracurriculars on top of schoolwork. I walk to and from school sometimes, but it's only a 15 minute walk and that doesn't do much for me. Healthy eating is also a bit of a struggle, because there's not much healthy food in my house and I don't really know what to eat that could help me lose weight anyways. I'm aware that counting calories as a teenager can do more harm than good, so I'm prepared to avoid that, but maybe I should be doing it? I've done workouts on youtube and such and seen some improvements in my legs, but nowadays I'm worried it'll make me bulky/make my legs look bigger because of muscle being built under fat that I'm not actively losing. So now I'm pretty lost and unsure where to go, and need some sort of direction on how to do this in a non-harmful way. Thank you. :-) ",

Counting calories is something that you actually should be doing because it\u2019s the only thing that will actually make you lose weight. You simply need to be taking in less calories than you exert if you hope to lose weight weight or vice versa taking more calories than you exert if you hope to gain weight. I would opt for a maintenance if I was you. I would also strongly recommend trying to get as much protein as you possibly can in every day. The ideal number is to shoot for 1 g/ pound of bodyweight. This will help your figure look better without even exercising. Fat at 50 grams a day and you will be set. Backfill the rest of your calories with carbs. I recommend calisthenics and plyometric activities. These can be accomplished at home with little to no equipment. Squats lunges short movements of explosive work can give you the Toned look that you hope to achieve. Good luck!",

                "guys your conversation actually lightened up my mood so thank you \ud83d\ude2d but of course, body fat percentage is an important factor. What I would say devastated me the most is me knowing how this body fat percentage came so high, I spent years with the worst sleeping schedule that lead me to only having energy to do architecture, my eating habits were crap, i sometimes went days with 500 calories. So the devastation was because I knew I did this to myself and I was upset I did not catch up earlier. But better late than never. My blood work is good and I am not aware of any underlying health issues. However I am aware that me being healthy now does not equal me being healthy later, and I want to take action. Also appearance wise I look like a 158cm/58kg girl that has good genetics with fat distribution but needs a whole lot of muscle to be happy lol",

Today, right now, this is what the situation is.    \n\nI wouldn't take that one BF% reading to the bank, but you already know what you enjoy -- muscle.  Good stuff, can't hurt you, as long as you chase it in good balance and moderation and safety (improving on your 500 calorie past efforts).

Because of the amount of exercising I was doing, BMI was useless as I got towards my normal weight because while it showed 25, my BF was 20%.  BMI was ok as a metric to track my progress, from the beginning, but if you exercise a lot as part of your journey, the delta between what your BF wuold be from your BMI and what it actually is, becomes much larger once you pass from obesity to just overweight. Had I used BMI, I would have overshot by a lot.\n\nThe other thing to watch for is loose skin. Or not-tight-skin.\n\nAlso, I was originally aiming for no love handles at all, but never realized that only happens below 15% BF, and, while my skin isn't lose, I don't know if it is tight enough for that. But it looks really good now, so maybe I didn't remember that most people have slight love handles unless they are ripped and showing abs. Looking at BF% picture charts helps a lot with that.\n\nNot saying pushing it as far as possible is wrong, but after such a large loss of weight, getting to normal weight and maintaining for awhile, as you get used to your new (old) body again has a lot of advantages. Then decide if there is going to be a second step and what it will be. For me I would like to do at least one bulk cycle.

                "If I'm understanding this supposed \"new science\" on how exercise effects weight loss, eating back your workouts would probably actually result in a calorie surplus (specifically between the workout and those foods).",
                "\"Is it bad to eat back walking/running calories if I'm trying to mantain my weight?\"\n\nThat is what you are supposed to do.:)\n\nGenerally, when all is well, a person eats normally and is moderately active and doesn't lose or gain weight.\n\nBut let's say that person starts training for a marathon. Unless they start consciously eating more, they will probably start losing weight, because their body doesn't just automatically signal them to eat enough to compensate.\n\nIndeed, that is why many of us our on this subreddit. We became sedentary, but our bodies just went along eating normally and we gained weight.\n\nSo we have to eat less and exercise more, lose the excess weight, and then eat normally again and exercise enough to not gain the weight back.\n\nBut yes, to maintain your weight you must eat enough to balance out what you burn. If you eat more than that, you will gain weight, less and you will lose weight.\n\nAfter I lost my weight, I chose the amount of activity I would need in my workouts so that I could eat normally, without having to monitor it. That works out to 2200 calories and I workout an hour 5 days a week. I don't have to think about it, it just works.\n\nBut, if I started working out more, for a marathon or something, I would have to consciously up my daily calories. My body normally eats 2100 to 2300, but if my activity puts me outside that band, then I kind of would have to consciously add more food.",
                "The exercise you do would be part of your TDEE so eatin back the calories would mean you are eating at TDEE and maintaining. Do it.\u00a0",

I also avoid eating at restaurants.\n\n>I go on a website where I calculate how many calories I've burned from walking/running and I eat them back on most days\n\nYou can't estimate the calories you eat or the calories you burn with enough precision. I could program one of those sites in less than an hour.\n\nThe error margins are huge. Even with scale and nutritional labels (which are also estimations, nobody sends their food to a lab). An apple's calories, for example, depend on the amount of sun the tree has got, and your scale can't account for it.\n\nThe best estimation you can get is the BMR, which is maybe +/- 10% accurate. Everything else is a guess, more or less good, usually not so. The sedentary level is probably ok. \n\nAnd the TDEE model is not additive. The more exercise you add, the smaller the impact is. There is always one. But your body adapts. \n\n**Easting back your exercise calories has a huge risk of eating too much back, because of this.**\n\nEspecially with walking and light/medium intensity activities. \n\nIf you want to improve the estimations you can use values from here:\n\n[https://pacompendium.com/](https://pacompendium.com/)\n\nSo, if it works for you, it works. If not, is because the whole thing is not accurate, only rough estimations, of estimation, over other estimations ...",

Now I haven't gained any weight so far but I still feel quite guilty after eating back my not so accurately estimated  \"burned\" calories.",
                "Maintenance calories are the calorie level you eat and maintain a roughly constant weight. This depends of course on exercise and includes burned calories.\n\nI don't care about the number and if is \"sedentary\" (assuming that is what you mean with maintenance), I look at the scale and adjust the number of food calories to get the desired effect (lose, gain, or maintain).\n\nSomething like 10k walking per day will still need a decent amount of carbs."

Since then I\u2019ve gone up and down in the same 10 pound range countless times. \n\nA few weeks ago I signed up for Noom on an impulse (they were having a sale and I\u2019ve been wanting to try it for a couple years) and I\u2019ve already seen a big difference even in just my mindset (I\u2019m also down 5 pounds). Consistency is key, and not giving up when I have a bad day or end up binging on chocolate lol. Dust off and keep course correcting. \n\nAnyway I\u2019m rambling now, thanks for reading if you did and I\u2019ll be looking forward to your updates \ud83d\ude03",
                "My weight is bouncy. From 331 to 225...to 285, 300...Then back down to 240. Then 270. And now....285.\n\nEver since I gained so much of my weight back, I've been finding it so difficult to get back on track. All my efforts only last a few days.\n\nBut due to recent events in my life, ice decided to do a complete lifestyle change for 30 days. That's all. No obligation past that. But 30 days of discipline. To show myself I can do it.\n\nToday is, coincidentally, day 1. Last night was the night my friend helped me come to the 30 day goal. Yestwrsay was Also the day my sleep doctor told me to stop drinking caffiene for 2 weeks-so I'm doing that as well. Let's do this!",
                "I\u2019m with you! I\u2019ve been at it for 3 months as of today, down from 345 to 324. My goal is to be under 300 by the holidays.",

                "I just screenshot your first paragraph and made it my FB story \n\nThat stirred something in me. Mine always used to be to create an animal rescue/sanctuary.  It wasn't until I was trying to adopt some kittens and speaking to local rescues, understanding what they do and what they see, that I realised it wasn't about being around cute animals everyday. It was about seeing poorly, sick and abused animals and trying to rehabilitate and rehome them. And also seeing the worst of humanity. I don't know if I actually could do that. \n\nAnyhoo, it's really made me question some things in my life so thank you for that",
                "I have been on my journey since around June 25th give or take a day or two I have a big event coming up in September that I wanted to be slimmer for and I\u2019ve dropped 23lbs since! This gives me a goal post my event. I\u2019m in as well \ud83e\ude77",

                "I\u2019m in! I\u2019m on my second go at hopefully losing 110lbs. I\u2019m 86lbs down right now and have been stagnant for a bit. We deserve this for Christmas!",
                "I\u2019m in! I started on 8th July and I\u2019ve lost just shy of 20lbs so far. I\u2019m really motivated with my food to eat healthy and maintain my deficit but I\u2019ve had l trouble getting exercise in. I have a real issue with being uncomfortable and I will do anything to avoid it, but I know  it\u2019s good for me. Also, as a short person, I need to do it sooner rather than later as my weight loss is going to stall at some point without it. \n\nSo this is the kick up the bum I need. Plus I have an awesome dress I love but I\u2019ve only worn once and I\u2019ve love to be back in it by Christmas.",
                "I love this idea. I'm in. Best of luck everyone.",
                "I've said exactly the same things about what I'd do if I came into a lot of money! You are right, there's no reason we all can't have that, no matter what our budget. Moving more is free and so is calorie-tracking. \n\nI've lost 19 pounds since February, by logging meals and walking more. I'd be very happy to lose another 19 pounds by Christmas, so I'm in! We're also eating a bit more Mediterranean-style than we had been, and eating a lot of homegrown salads. Food quality has never been our problem, just portion control, lol. Logging helps with that. Husband is dieting with me and we have been aiming for a one pound loss every 2 weeks. If more comes off, that's great, but one is our goal.",
                "I\u2019m in also! I\u2019ve currently just started my ttc journey and losing a few lbs would absolutely be a benefiting factor on that journey! Thank you for inviting us and for being the kick in the butt we clearly all needed \ud83d\ude0a",
                "I love this! I\u2019ve lost weight more than a few times over my life but never thought to look at it as giving myself a gift. Your post came at a perfect time too as I was already gearing up to get back on track with calorie counting, exercising regularly, etc.  \n\nWe got this!",

I was heartbroken when I went to put it on and I\u2019m slightly too big for it. Because of how confident she was in her skills, her seam allowances are so tiny the coat can\u2019t be altered. My goal is to be able to have that coat on this Christmas Eve.",

                "I love this! I had been toying with the idea of doing some kind of \"100 day challenge\" of trying to stick to my plans for that length of time, but something like this would work too. I understand you're not allowed to create accountability posts, but I will be following along!",
                "IM IN!!! I'm not gonna set my goal weight for the end of the 4 months because I feel like the pressure of getting there would get to my head but I know that when I stick to it I loose weight pretty quickly anyways! I owe it to myself to live the lifestyle I've always wanted. \n\neverytime you update on your journey I'll update mine in the comments aswell. I'm actually really excited about it. WE GOT THIS!!!!!",
                "I think that this is a nice way to frame it! I'm definitely more motivated thinking of a gift versus a chore. Right now my goal is to weigh less and exercise more than I do right now. I've found that I can get demotivated when looking at a goal weight (even though I have one) but looking back on my progress means more to me. \n\nSo for me, right now I weigh 192.0 lbs (as of this morning) and walk about 10,000 steps a day. By Christmas I intend on seeing changes to both of those!",

But what I\u2019ve found that has really helped me lose weight is: 1) learning stress reduction techniques like breathing exercises, meditation & yoga. 2) getting rid of most added sugars - notice not all, I don\u2019t give myself hard lines on my diet, I just focus on considering what\u2019s in front of me & how badly I want that treat vs the pay off of saying no. 3) focusing on protein & water - most of my cravings leave once I\u2019ve had a few bites of a protein heavy meal & I\u2019ve actually been able to feel myself getting full after about half of my meal, whereas before I would never feel full until my stomach hurt. 4) stopping mid meal to let my food settle & really assess how hungry I am at that point. 5) use the calorie tracker as more of a guideline & less hard rules - essentially eat the way you want & log everything, then tweak what you need to add or cut back on for your goals. This is how I learned I wasn\u2019t eating nearly enough protein lol. Also, following the calorie tracker to such a stringent level is how I gave myself an ED & I wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone. \nPlease remember above weight loss, health is really the most important part.

Nutrition is more important than cardio as well. It\u2019s fine if you can only lift 30kg on bench. \n\nPull a workout from the internet that includes at least these five muscle groups (chest, upper back,  lower back, shoulders, legs). Find a weight that you can barely do 3 sets of 8 at. Usually it\u2019s split into Day A, Day B, Rest day, repeat. This gives you two days to rest before repeating the same exercise. \n\nIf you are able to get 3 sets of all 8 then you increase weight. (The first 2 months, don\u2019t increase weight very aggressively as you learn the lifts and get used to the soreness) If you can\u2019t do 3x8 then you try to get that much the next workout day, but don\u2019t increase the weight. This is called progressive overload and it\u2019s the most important part. After the first couple months, you should always be going within a say 4 reps of failure. Another important thing is to either get a personal trainer to teach you the lifts or to watch YouTube videos and record yourself in order to ensure that the movements are right and you don\u2019t hurt yourself. \n\nFor nutrition, eat 2g of protein per kg of weight and reduce processed foods as much as possible.\n\nAbove is how you get low in body fat percentage. It does not make you lose weight, in fact you will probably gain weight, but lose body fat.",

The additional weight you are carrying can limit your ability to workout (that could be what your are feeling), perform certain exercises or make you get tired fast, to properly lose weight, focus on a balanced diet to support your goals. This is key as people don't realize dieting is +75% on a weight loss journey. Working out is tiresome, can be risky and can be headache and isn't even the most important part, dieting should be an \"easier\" problem to tackle.  \n  \nFor workouts, concentrate on compound exercises to build overall strength effectively.

Begin with low or no weight to learn the correct form and avoid injuries, then gradually add weight that feels comfortable. Avoid ego lifting; no matter what others or even your friends are lifting, an injury would set you back significantly. Build a strong foundation to safely reach your goals in a healthy way. You might start with a full-body routine, doing one or two exercises per muscle group. This way, you can include most compound movements in one session and train every other day, allowing a day of rest between workouts. This approach will help you learn proper form and adjust to working out. At your age, you will likely see changes relatively quickly.\n\n\n\nNutrition:   \nAt your age, it may be challenging since you might not control your meals. Try talking to your parents about your goals; they might help you out. If they don\u2019t take you seriously, don\u2019t worry, it happened to most of us. To manage your intake, use the MyFitnessPal app (there is a free version) to track your calories. Aim for no more than 2,500 calories a day, keep your protein intake high (0.75-1g/lb), which is around 140-190g of protein daily (more could cause damage to your kidneys, so be cautious). Keep carbs around 200g and fats around 100g. Drink plenty of water, about a gallon a day, to help with protein absorption and other benefits. Track your progress for a month and see how you feel and how your body reacts. Aim to eat every 3 to 4 hours when possible; bringing a snack to class might help.\n\n\n\nIf you feel hungry, eating more vegetables (as they are usually low on calories, but high on carbs, keep that in mind) can help you feel full. Your body will adjust over time, and you might stop feeling hungry. If you feel tired during workouts, adding a bit more carbs could help, but avoid excessive carb intake. If you lose weight, gain weight, or see no change, don\u2019t worry. You are likely building muscle, which weighs more than fat and takes up less space. The best way to gauge progress is by looking in the mirror, if you look leaner, you\u2019re on the right track. If you notice unwanted weight gain and it isn\u2019t muscle, consider reducing your intake to 2,250 calories per day for the next month. Your calorie intake may stay the same, but carbs and fats might decrease.\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t worry about specific exercises for each muscle group at the beginning, as compound movements target multiple muscle groups simultaneously. Follow this advice, but be ready to adjust as you get to know your body better. By the time you go to college, you should be in great shape, not like Dwayne Johnson or Captain America, but with an athletic body that provides a solid foundation for continued growth if that\u2019s your goal."

            "I\u2019ve had an attempt with a 5:2 diet just before the summer but I\u2019ve had very little success to be fully honest. Many people love it because you can eat as you normally would for five days and then restrict your intake to a quarter for two days (which must not be consecutive).\u00a0\n\nHowever, I soon became obsessed with numbers on my restricted days and it felt very tiring mentally, so I\u2019d eat even more than I normally would on the days off as I called them \ud83d\ude02 After three weeks, I had no gains and no losses and I simply quit right then and there.\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t know what you can take from that, but it\u2019s only fair to say it\u2019s not for everyone and you have to try to see if it fits you.\u00a0",
            "There are numerous ways to do intermittent fasting, but I think each method has it\u2019s benefits and drawbacks. For example, if you\u2019re trying to lose weight, try daily time-restricted fasting. This method works because it\u2019s consistent and so your body adapts to it, but also the fact that you end up consuming very few calories evey day.\n\nIf you try other extreme methods like the 5:2 method, where you eat normal food for five days straight and then fast for 2 consecutive days, it\u2019s hard to have any consistency because 2 days is kind of extreme. The alternate-day method, though a little better than 5:2, makes you have these alternating energy highs and lows (which pretty much feel like energy spikes and crashes), so again, it\u2019s hard to live a \u201cdieting rollercoaster\u201d life.",

It might sound tough, and tbh, it kinda is at first.\n\nBut think about it: you\u2019ll actually be snoozing for 8 of those 16 fasting hours, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019re gonna feel it, huh? Then, you\u2019ll probably adjust little by little to your new eating and fasting hours when you\u2019re awake, just like I did. And I did lose quite a bit of weight the past couple of weeks, so it\u2019s def worth it IMO!",

It wasn\u2019t until recently, when I started my fitness journey, that I learned about the 16/8 method, which is a good starting point if you\u2019re new to intermittent fasting.

I can tell you about 1; me.\u00a0 What I found out was you can\u2019t lose weight without changing your lifestyle, and that takes time. \n\nLooking for a weight loss quick fix is essentially the same mindset as eating compulsively. A quick start, and a bad finish. You want to establish long term habits that keep you eating right and exercising regularly.

So try to stick with the same foods, same time etc. If you eat a large meal before sleeping you may find yourself awake because your body is digesting the food some people pass out after eating a lot. \n\nBut I would start counting your calories from 12am to 12am and be strict about it. So I eat 4-5 meals a day I would track what times I ate it and the cut off time would be 12am\n\nSo example \n\nWork meal 3-4am \nBreakfast 10-11am\nSnack - 3-4pm\nPreworkout meal (6:30-7pm)\nPost workout meal 10pm",

That amounts to 0.5-1 Starbucks drink if you want to look at it that way. \n\n\nHere\u2019s an article from Harvard Health that may be of some interest:\n\n[Eat protein and do weight training. Your metabolism increases whenever you eat, digest, and store food, a process called thermic effect of food. Protein has a higher thermic effect compared with fats and carbohydrates because it takes longer for your body to burn protein and absorb it.  It's not clear how much of an effect protein has on metabolism, but studies suggest the best approach is to combine adequate protein intake with weight training, which increases muscle mass \u2014 and that also can boost metabolism.

What happens when you eat very few calories is that your body tries to adapt low calorie demands because it is forced to survive on little. Your metabolism then goes down, which is why people who lose a lot of weight fast end up gaining it back as soon as they go back to their normal calorie intake. I totally understand you trying to get answers on how to increase your metabolism and keep off the weight completely; you need to be exercising, eating plenty of protein, and getting enough sleep",

Here are some practical tips to help you get the most out of your pre workout nutrition:\n\n1. **Lunch Timing**: Try to have a substantial lunch 3-4 hours before your workout. This should give your body enough time to process, digest and convert the food into energy.\n2. **Balanced Meals**: Make sure your lunch includes a good mix of protein, carbs, and healthy fats, like grilled chicken with quinoa and vegetables which provide sustained energy.\n3. **Pre Workout Snack**: Since your workout is in the late afternoon, try having a smaller snack about 30-60 minutes before you exercise. A good option might be Greek yogurt with some fruit or 30-60 grams of nuts and a piece of fruit. Try not to eat very heavy or greasy foods as they might weigh you down.\n4. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink water throughout the day. Sometimes that feeling of tiredness or fatigue can be due to dehydration.\n5. **Experiment**: Try different snack sizes and timings to see what works best, try adjusting it a bit every time so you can keep record of it and make accurate conclusions. You might find that having your snack 90 minutes before your workout works better for you, instead of 60 minutes for example.\n6. **Listen to Your Body**: Everyone is different, so it might take several tries, after some trial and error to figure out what works best for you, you will be on the right track.\n\nHopefully, modifying these aspects of your nutrition will help improve your performance on those later workout days.",

Since your working out at home you won\u2019t have that issue getting others sick. \n\nSince covid can cause alot of Respiratory Issues and muscle aches it can interfere with working out as the body needs oxygen. \n\nThe primary reason why it\u2019s bad to workout when sick is recovery. When you break down muscle tissue and you want it to rebuild and recover you are using your body\u2019s resources think of your computer with a like 20 tabs open vs 3 tabs there\u2019s a lot of energy and resources and management that\u2019s is being used on all those tabs being open.\n\nSame with your body if your body is fighting a cold or flu or symptoms it needs those resources to fight the invaders and recover. Your body has already dedicated those resources to recovering from being sick. It will have a hard time trying to do both recovery from sickness and recovery from working out. \n\nWorking out while sick can hinder your recovery thus putting you at risk for getting sicker because of your weakened immune system so what can happen is not recovering properly to rebuild muscle tissue so it\u2019s a lose lose situation \n\nYou know your body better than anyone and what it\u2019s capable of. You can do a mild workout to test the waters. \n\nA light 45 minute workout with less sets more rest time. Or cut the volume in half and do less and see how you feel from there.

Average the weights before and after the week, and you know how much you gained or lost over the week. Add all the calories up and subtract 3500 for each lb you gained or add 3500 for each lb you lost. Then divide by 7. That\u2019s your daily maintenance calories. This method adjusts for the mislabeling of the typical food you eat, and your individual propensity to cheat without realizing it. You\u2019ll find you\u2019re eating way more than you thought. \n\nOnce you have maintenance, you drop 250 calories and day and that equals 2 lbs per month of weight loss.",

I work at a coffee place and make an asiago bagel with egg, bacon, cheese, onions, avocado and cream cheese for my lunch break. I average 3000 calories a day. I workout almost daily with a push/pull/legs split. I am 5'11 and recently went from 160lbs to 174lbs, but I've noticed I'm gaining a lot more of a gut than I ever thought I would. I'm considering calling off the bulk because while I am noticing minimal gain in chest, shoulders, biceps, legs, etc., I'm gaining a large gut and have never had to deal with something like this and feel very uncomfortable.

            "3000 seems like too much. The more you are above maintenance calories, the more fat you will gain. The literature and experts suggests that beginners should gain 1-1.5% weight per month MAX in order to gain with a good muscle ratios. At 160, that would mean 2.4 lbs per month, so it should have taken you roughly 6 months to gain that much weight. If you gained it faster than that its kind of expected that you would put on a lot of fat with your muscle.\n\nMy honest advice, and its probably not what you want to hear, but at this point I would switch to a cut and get back down to a body fat level you are comfortable with. Use the militaries waist formula to estimate your body fat now, and lose max 1 lb per week on a cut until you really like the way you look and retest body fat levels every month. Then switch back to a bulk and do it WAY slower while monitoring body fat percentage. If you determine that you were gaining 2.4 lbs per month, I would go for more like 1.5 lbs per month next time. You should basically always be getting higher in body fat percentage during a bulk (cutting is for losing body fat percentage), but not to the extent that you did. Generally, I don't think cutting is a great tool for non event based dieting (ie unless you are doing it for a contest or photoshoot or vacation). This is because its hard to keep off fat if you are going below your normal bodyfat percentage, and it hides the fact that your habits haven't permanently changed. However, since you just bulked and this is above your normal body fat percentage, I'd try to get back down to something closer to your norm, because staying above your norm body fat percentage for a long time resets your norm to the higher number (reverse is not the case).",

            "Heres the science (simplified):\n\nNo diets work for 95% of people because they gain it all back. The 5% that doesn't gain it back does so by being EXTREME for the rest of their lives. For example, my friend went from obese to 6 pack, and kept it for 10 years, but he worked out 250 times per year and ate chicken broccoli 6x per week, and weighed himself EVERY day. He didn't miss days for anything.  \n  \nInstead of dieting, you should make lifestyle changes that are sustainable. Those changes should be centered around the following:  \n-No processed foods or artificial sugar (eating these foods make you eat more than you need even weeks later)  \n-Get enough protein, about 1g per lb of muscle that you have (this is because protein lets you retain muscle and build muscle when otherwise it would be stored as fat... its also satiating)  \n-Lift weights but start really, really slow given your age (this is like protein in that it stores your extra calories as muscle instead of fat). Also note, that you won't be able to get \"big\" like a guy no matter how much you lift.  \n-Increase your activity in all possible ways by committing to lifestyle changes (same as above, plus it gives you energy to do the lifts and it improves hormone health which means lower bodyfat)\n\nThe other option is the medical route of a obesity medication (eg Ozempic). These drugs really actually work, but they are lifelong, and if you don't lift weights and eat LOTS of protein, you will lose weight in an extremely unhealthy way (ie you will lose way too much muscle). Total muscle is a super strong predictor of longevity, so you don't want to lose too much if you go this route.",

            "I'm **not** learned in the subject at all, I haven't gone to classes, read books etc, so I can understand ignoring my post. \nBut I *have* been in your situation, and there are some things I wish I knew before I entered into the journey of losing weight.\n\nFirst of all, your best friend in the entire world is water, I can not hype water enough, it's a miracle drug, if you're hungry, you can drink a litre of water and feel filled. \nAlso I started thinking of sleep as a speed hack, if you're hungry late at night? drink a litre of water, and go to bed. There you go, now it's breakfast, food.\nSomething to note is that the body can only efficiently filter 0.8-1L of water an hour, so I'd recommend staying within that limit, but don't get worried, you can drink a lot of water.\n\n\nThe most important thing to learn however when losing weight is calories.\nPeople love to spout information about this and that, carbs, trans fats, blabla, while that is all true, it doesn't matter that much to someone trying to lose extreme weight, it's good information for when you're at a normal weight sure, but when losing weight? just count calories, that should be your bible, think of your weight as a mathematical problem. \n1 kg= 7700 calories, let's say your body burn 2000 calories a day, technically you can lose ~2kg a week if you simply don't eat anything.\nI wouldn't recommend doing that of course, but that's thinking with calories, you could technically eat a bag of chips a day if you want, as long as it has less calories than what your body burns in a day, it's just straight up math.\nThere are sites to calculate your daily calorie consumption online.\n\nAnother thing I wish I knew before the journey was that it never hurts consuming daily vitamins/minerals pills, no matter which way you decide to lose weight, it's very hard to get everything the body needs everyday, so this is just a good way to make sure nothing goes wrong with the body's needs, and if you gain excess of anything, you'll just end up peeing it out.\n\nAlso, people tend to simply tell you to exercise, you don't have to do that, exercise burns calories, yes, but as long as you stay within your limit of calories you don't have to supplement your calorie deficiency with exercising, sure it speeds it along, no doubt about that, and I personally like cycling during the weekend, but it's not a required thing for losing weight.\n\nI'd suggest getting a calorie deficiency of roughly 1000, that way you lose a kg a week, if not more depending on how many calories your body burns everyday, 2000 sounds like a fairly plausible one for you, but again, check online for a calculator to calculate it correctly.\n\nAt the end of the day, if there is one thing you take away from this post, I want it to be this:\nIf you burn 2000 calories everyday, as long as you consume less than that everyday, you WILL lose weight, it DOESN'T really matter where those calories come from, carbs? fat? it doesn't matter, as long as it's less calories than\u00c2\u00a0your burn everyday.\nWhat works for you depends on the type of person you are.\n\nI personally were 400lbs ~180 kg since my teens, at 33 I started doing the following:\nI stopped eating, I ate 1 meal every third day, for about 3 months I kept this up, and water of course.\nAfter 3 months of doing that I was down to 290 lbs ~140kg(its fast as hell in the start)\nHowever I started getting sick regularly, so I figured maybe eating more regularly was a better idea, so I ate a chicken breast, and a cucumber everyday.\n\n\n2 months later, I'm still getting sick, and I'm now starting to lose my hair, but I was down to 230 LBS ~115kg\nAt this point I started to realize that i'm really just hurting myself, I started looking up some information online, I started to eat 3 meals a day, which added up to ~1000 calories in total, breakfast Protein Oatmeal, lunch Protein oatmeal, dinner a stew with a lot of meat, vegetables etc, things the body need, and a multi vitamin/mineral pill for the things that I simply don't gain normally.\n\n\nFast Forward 3 months, I'm 190 lbs ~95kg. I'm not sick anymore, and I'm regaining my hair. \nSure, the weight loss was slower now, but I didn't much mind anymore, my original goal was 100kg anyway.\n\n5 months later, which is now, I'm at 85kg, and I still have the same routine, oatmeal for breakfast and lunch, and my stew for dinner with a pill. I don't really lose weight anymore, I tend to hover at around 84 as my lowest now. I'm in general a really big guy, my side of the family is, and I'm 187cm tall, at this point I probably have around 3-5 kg in loose skin as well, so I understand why i'm not really losing anymore weight, I think i'm at a fairly normally weight,\nLately I've started experimenting, keeping my diet routine the same, and having something like two  pizza with an insane amount of sauce and fries on the weekend (saturday & sunday) and I seem to lose the extra transient weight during the week, so i'm fairly comfortable with that kind of lifestyle, eat the diet I do, but eat literally whatever I want during the weekend, and not really gaining any weight, that is what works for me.\n\n\nThe reason I went into this detail is to clarify that what works for me, or Person A, or person B, wouldn't necessarily work for you, its a very personal thing I feel like, Hopefully something of what I said clicks for you, but I honestly believe it wont matter unless you've really hit the moment when you basically say \"Fuck it, I'm just going to do it\" \nFor me the trigger, funnily enough, was family and friends around me stopping to encourage me to lose weight, it meant that they finally gave up trying to\u00c2\u00a0convince me to lose weight, they didn't believe I could do it anymore, and who can blame them? 33 years of being overweight, I get it, but it made me incredibly motivated to almost sort of spite them by doing what they didn't think I could anymore.\nI guess i'm a fairly spiteful person lol.\n\nTLDR: Eat less calories than what your body burns, depending on how much less your consume, the faster it is, doesn't matter what kind of calories you consume, be it pizza, or salads.\n\n\nBad formatting, hade to post this on my Phone.",

            "First off, try measuring your waist instead. Its a really solid measure of relative body fat percentage. I don't know what inbody machine you are using, but as you know the scales aren't particularly accurate for body fat percentage (and all the sub-categories are almost completely useless). However, if you are putting on weight, but your lifts aren't going up then you are probably gaining fat... so its not the measurement.\n\nSecond, you should concentrate on just maintaining weight until you can figure out why your lifts aren't improving. Maybe you need to switch up your workout to periodize it. You should look into how to break through plateaus on youtube. Until your lifts are going up, you aren't making new muscle, so having a calorie surplus is a negative.\n\nYou might also look at your hormone health (testosterone for example). A prolonged cut (which you did) can reduce T levels for a while. T levels don't seem to make much of a difference at the high end of normal in terms of muscle gain, but they do make a difference at the low end (and of course at 2-3x supernatural steroid levels).\n\nGenerally speaking it sounds from your description like you are doing things mostly right... it might be you don't realize you are doing something wrong, or it might be that your genetics don't fit your workout, or it might be that your workout is good, but you need some advanced techniques like periodization or drop sets. If its genetic, then you need to increase or decrease the volume/intensity until you find what fits your genetics. Remember that even one single extra rep is progressive overload. Oh, also, I'd look into recovery if you are feeling really spent all the time.",

            "I've been going through this a bit, as I'm getting back into the gym at near 40 after some injuries. I've found two things that have helped: First, I started slow... I was doing 60-75 hard minutes in the gym 4x per week. The issue was that when I came back, I would lose motivation at like 20 minutes. The solution for me has been to design a workout that is only 30 minutes (more achievable) and then just do it everyday. So I always go, and I do like 2 sets of 5 exercises and leave. I plan on slowly building up my ability to \"push through,\" at which point I'll add exercises as I get more used to the additional work. You need to design your gym goals to be things that you can accomplish, so that you feel good about the work you are doing.\n\nAdditionally, getting my testosterone up through lifestyle and some supplementation has helped as well. In retrospect, I think there is some evidence that low T effects ability to push through tough things. However, I would say that I'm not a doctor and I didn't expect improving my t to help me push through my workouts. I looked at T because high T results in VERY slightly lower bodyfat percentage, but it seemed to help my mental gym performance.\n\nI don't really know what you mean about getting tired through a couple reps. Maybe you need to lower the weight, or track it more closely so that you are really trying to beat your old record of reps by a tiny bit (\"I did 4 last time, I'm going to get 5 this time\").\n\nAs far as your overall tiredness and weight loss... Weight loss causes tiredness. Your body is programmed to get you back to old fat levels, and part of the way it does it is to make you tired so you move less. You might need to add some good fats into your diet for hormone levels. You might need to see if you can add like 100 calories a day without putting on weight - there isn't one number of maintenance calories, its a range of several hundred calories and if you are at the bottom of it, you will be more tired and less active, then if you are at the top of your maintenance range. Mostly I think you need to start slow but deliberately",
            "Personally I would recommend trying to find a more balanced approach to eating and training, less highs and lows. Also I wouldn't worry about getting a killer workout in every time, training until my muscles are about to explode and organs about to fall out. If you are not getting sore every time, that is fine so long as you show up and put in the work. hope this helps."

            "Of course you will see changes in 5 months.  A beginner can do up to 1 lb of muscle a week in the first 8 weeks in studies, but generally its like .1-.5lbs of muscle in the first year. You can lose about 1 lb per week of fat. So assuming you are newish to lifting, you might max be able to add 2.5 lbs of muscle and subtract that much in fat in the first 5 months. I don't know your body fat percentage or weight, but lets say you are 26% bf at 210. If you trade 2.5 lbs of fat into muscle you'd be at 24.8% body fat with significantly more muscle. I would say that this is the realistic max you could achieve if you do all the basics right. This would make you look much stronger, while its enough off your waist line that you might need new pants.\n\nAlternatively, assuming you do two months of cutting, take a one month break, then two more months of cutting, you might be able lose 16 lbs without losing too much muscle in the same amount of time if you cut. So lets say 15 lbs lost are fat and 1 lb lost is muscle. You'd go from 210 to 194 lbs with 20.4% body fat, but less muscle than you started with.\n\nI might suggest doing a recomp for a couple months first (maintain weight), rather than cut/bulk, because people tend to fail on the cut side of things and end up fatter than they were. Recomp will slow your progress slightly, but its way safer and it works well for beginners. You also put on more muscle, more quickly when you have more fat. Cutting a lb/week is miserable... its like being sick for months at a time (at least for me). Its also the case that people tend to rebound from cuts. If you can't make permanent lifestyle changes, then the cuts don't stick.\n\nThere are exactly 4 things you need to do (basics):\n\n1. Lift a lot and don't get hurt (15-20 hard sets per week per muscle group, making sure to hit the big ones)\n2. No processed foods and no added sugar\n3. 1g of protein per lb per day\n4. During cutting, you need to track weight and calories (during recomp just make sure you are not gaining weight once every couple days)\n5. Extras: Sleep a lot, get lots of activity (cardio/steps etc), get outside for sunlight for testosterone.\n\nMATH EDITED PER COMMENT BELOW",
            "The fastest way to make visible changes is through fat loss. In 5 months you can lose around 20lbs of fat. If you also lift weights and your diet is on point, you might also gain a little muscle during that time.",
            "Thanks a lot man that was the advice I needed",
            "The advice is fine, but I disagree with the numbers you mentioned.\n\n\n1lb muscle gained per month for an experienced lifter is a huge over estimation. If that were true, then a natural athlete with 5 years of training would be able to put on another 120lbs of muscle in the next 10 years.\n\n\nRealistically, a new lifter might gain 10lbs of muscle in their first year on average. A life time of lifting might allow for 20-40lbs of muscle gained during their entire life.",

Watch some Jeff Nippard videos on YouTube whenever you're bored and have some down time, the content is very beginner friendly but teaches fundamentals that are useful even to advanced lifters.",

            "I would say the PT is spot on, which is why bulk/cut can be a more efficient method. If you want to stick to just a recomp and want to play the slow game, you'll need to find reliable ways to track progress. Probably the best thing to do is measure gym performance. If you are slowly getting stronger especially for reps and your weight is pretty stable, you are almost certainly gaining muscle and losing fat.",
            "What\u2019s your goal? \n\nBecause a Recomp is playing the long game. You have to have a shit ton of patience and realized it may take 1-2 years and that is locked in with consistency. Recomp isn\u2019t all that great because it\u2019s like trying to drive on ice. You spin your wheels and eventually you\u2019ll end up moving forward but you can also end up staying in the same place.\n\nAlso when you look at social media online your watching people at the end goal or close to. So they had a head start. Cuz no one\u2019s gonna watch someone in the same position for 2-3 years. You want to see results you want to see what is achievable. \n\nA lot of these influencers had a head start whether it be 1 or 2 or 10 years. Plus some fake there stuff and don\u2019t even eat or workout how they show online they just do it for clicks.\n\nTo see progress more sooner you\u2019ll have to choose between building muscle or losing weight. A Recomp is like essentially maintaince. Gaintaining as I call it. Staying the same weight but whilst building muscles but with extremely extremely slow progress. If you have a year or 2 to spare with no rush and are patience you can Recomp. \n\nBut in general fitness does take time to see results usually in the 3,6,8 12 months marks but if you look and feel the same year after year then you gotta go back to the drawing board\n\nBy my definition of consistent is you\u2019ve done everything to a tee. Food Measurements. Macros. Sleep. Lift. Hydrate. No bingeing. Little to no alcohol. Little to no cake, sweets and desserts. And sacrifice going out and staying in or not drinking day after day night after night. Month after month.\n\nIf you want actual progress. You have to follow the lifestyle. Eat,Sleep,Lift,Shit. Repeat. Also your full body workout is a bit to much. So Recomp & your full body workout is probably why your not seeing results",
            "Does anyone know if beginner gains work the same for women? If she\u2019s only been at it less than a year, I would think recomp or a very slow cut is better than cut/bulk. I think really dedicated people pull off cut/bulk, but unless fitness is your big priority in life it\u2019s hard to manage it well enough. \n\nI wonder if you are working out as intensely as you should be. Like are you going to failure on each of your lifts? You might also get something out of switching to push/pull day with the added intensity. You go harder on each day, but get an extra day to recover. \n\nAdditionally, are you tracking your waist circumference for bf reasons? Waist directly correlates with bf% and is often better than tracking weight in recomp situations since you are maintaining your weight. A small reduction of waist is a big deal. \n\nFinally, note that the men/women on social media posts have great genetics and are mostly taking steroids in these transformations. Steroids for women make a HUGE difference since testosterone is so low to start. It also comes with terrible, terrible side effects. Just remember that the stuff online is fake.\n\nFor comparison, I have a friend who was a female college runner. Now (25f) she works and does some fitness social media and she\u2019s at maybe 12/13% bf. She works out 2-4 hours EVERY day (I\u2019ve seen it). That is probably at least 5x what you work out. She also strictly counts calories including weighing almost 100% of her food out and eating very healthy. No steroids, but she didn\u2019t transform as much as just ratchet up her lifestyle over time. She has great genetics, and puts that type of work in to give you a comparable for the social media people. Maybe assume that if you copied her lifestyle you\u2019d be at like 15% bf depending on genetics. \n\nIn my view ratcheting up your life (more lifting, more activity, better eating, better measurement) until you get where you want to be is the only way without cheating.",
            "split your workouts into categories by muscle for each day, you will grow your muscles much faster this way.\n\ne.g \n\npush\n\nbench, shoulder press, triceps extension\n\n  \npull\n\nlat pull down, rows, bicep curls\n\n  \nlegs\n\nsquats, hamstring curls, quad extensions\n\n  \neat a lot of CLEAN healthy foods to put on weight \n\nrip some ab workouts if you're feeling ambitious",

            "what should my full body workout consist of? like how many upper/lower body exercises?",
            "You're right, social media makes it look easy.\n\nThe only transformations that you will see in your feed are the amazing ones. More often than not those people have some combination of great genetics, taking PEDs, or are detrained to begin with.",
            "Your doing full body 3 times a week and your doing to many exercises in total. Which can hinder recovery time. It takes a muscle 72 hours to fully recover and that depends on your intensity and smaller muscles will recover a bit quicker compared to larger muscle groups.\n\nSo if your doing a full body workout 3 times a week you need to space it out so you can recover that is depending on your intensity level. So less is more meaning you don\u2019t want to be doing to much volume you want to start off on the low end of exercises and work your way up to see how well your body handles it.\n\nThat being said it all depends on your goal and how you want your body structured. Your a girl so by assumption you want a nice lower body and defined upper body. So I would structure a day where you have more of an upper body day with less lower and a lower body day with higher lower and less upper.\n\nFor example Monday 3 upper and 2 lower and for a lower Tuesday 4 lower and 2 upper. There could also be a day for just lower. \n\nA full body routine works best for some people with time constraints but it\u2019s usually done like a Monday full body and a Thursday full body twice a week. Then rest and recover. Cardio and abs but you need to be going hard.\n\nThere is a law of diminishing returns. At some point to much reps, sets and exercises will lead to less rate of return = less gains.\n\nYou might want to think about doing an upper body split and a lower body split. And that can be done 3-4 times a week.",

Anything like that please let me know. Thanks. ",
        "responses": [
            "8/10  \n  \nCritiques: Pretty heavy on triceps, biceps. No deadlifts or single leg RDLs or anything. No abs. In general you don't have any one sided things or rotation movements. I recommend dropping at least one of the exercises of each tri/bi and switching them for abs, deadlift variation and a rotation movement. I'd add a few reps to your arm raises so that you can do them at lower weight to avoid injury there (and make it easier to get up to the next weight since its big jumps)\n\nQuestions: Do you think you can manage 24 sets of your major muscle groups per week (eg. 24 sets of chest)? You don't get that much out of sets 15-24 there, but makes sense if you miss a workout or two each week, then it makes sense.\n\nGood: You hit all the muscle groups. All solid movements. Good split.\n\n<--- Just my opinion. It looks good though.",
            "That's an insane amount of volume, unless you ain't natty I wouldn't do that. I think you would benefit from going more intensely on fewer movements, which would maximize the gains. Also, you might want to use the barbell if at all possible, I'm not seeing that so maybe you don't have access? But you just aren't able to go as heavy without it, which probably limits a fair amount of growth. I'm seeing a whole lot of 3x10 sets, definitely mix up the rep ranges to get better results. I would recommend what I used to do for PPL, I saw huge gains in the period, but just copy Jeff Nippard's program he knows so much more than me.

            "Thanks for feedback, reason why i didn\u2019t do any deadlifts is no i don\u2019t get injured and just solely do dumbells and machines, and regarding abs i will need to implement it like in 1/2 months time when i\u2019m in gym constantly as for now im going and will be implementing that, and i follow this routine and manage to do weekly 2 times PPL a week, and it seems doable it\u2019s just push day takes a bit longer to do",
            "Thanks for the feedback will defo have a look at the youtube link",
            "You can do one leg RDLs with dumbells and not worry too much about your back. Thats what I do (I have some slipped discs from sports). I also can't lift heavy on deadlifts. Hip thrusts are another alternative that I like. Or there is like a hip thrust on a swiss ball that is good for that and core.\n\nIf you are doing it 2x per week: I would guess just statistically, you could do less volume and get very similar results. I would probably try to lower the volume slightly and maybe do some functional exercises around loaded mobility for sports that you like or mobility capabilities you lost. For example, I have tight hips so I do one leg knees over toes squats with full range of motion and lower weight for mobility - its improved my basketball game and given me back some range of motion. There isn't anything wrong with 24 sets per week of big muscle groups, but its really only been shown to benefit advanced lifters. so I think you just might get more from a diversity. I generally think people should shoot for 15+ hard sets. Hard is also key in studies, so if yours aren't 1-3 reps from failure, maybe the extra volume will help you. Maybe do less, and then when you plateau up the volume and see how much of a difference it makes for you (all dependent on genetics and recovery). I find that it doesn't make a difference for me, but I would say my genetics are average."

        "responses": [
            "This probably goes without saying but just in case: you can't target the love handles directly, you lose weight throughout your body. The love handles will reduce as a result.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, a calorie deficit is very simple. Just take in fewer calories than you put out. Doesn't matter if this is achieved through exercise or diet, but diet is easier. As you saw, trying to exercise yourself to a deficit is much harder as your body is very efficient at using energy. \n\nFirst, you have to find your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). This is the amount of calories you burn in a day while at rest. Let's say your BMR is 1500. That means if you laid in bed all day, you'd burn 1500 just staying alive. Now let's add daily activity in (doing literally anything, living your life) and your calorie expenditure might go up to 1800 calories a day (just a guess). If you ate 1500 calories a day, that puts you at a 300-calorie deficit, so you're losing weight.\n\nAdd a mile run, which burns ~300 calories, and that makes 2100 calories burnt in a day. If you eat 1500 calories, that puts you at a 600-calorie deficit, so you're losing MORE weight. But let's imagine you ate 3000 calories in a day (which is surprisingly easy), you'd have to burn 1200 calories in exercise just to break even. That's not easy is it?",
            "A calorie deficit is just taking in less calories than you need to maintain your weight. You can find the number of calories you need to maintain your weight in a calculator. After that, you must make sure you intake less than this. You could to this by eating less or burning calories. In general, burning calories off is a lot harder than not eating them in the first place. I learnt this from [here ](https://athleterundown.beehiiv.com/subscribe)if it helps you in your weightless."

If you're a beginner, or you're a trained person who has taken a massive amount of time off from the gym (let's use the term \"untrained\" to cover both groups), your body will experience a massive stimulus and as a consequence, a strong response to sudden training.\n\nUntrained people can get away with suboptimal methods and still see some progress. At the same time, if you're overweight/obese, you'll have an even stronger response to training. You'll build muscle more easily since you have more body fat to use as energy to facilitate workouts, and more importantly, recovery and muscle building.\n\nIf you train and diet responsibly and steadily over the course of the year and a half, you probably can reach your goal.

If you find that you get to the point in 6 months where you've stopped losing body fat (which just means your waist is expanding or staying the same), then you can consider a cut.\n\nI generally find that tracking calories is too hard longterm.

Losing weight is about improving your knowledge of nutrition and changing your lifestyle, your habits, and your identity. You can't just tell yourself to stop eating junk food, you have to believe that you're not the person who eats junk food.\n\nThe second possibility is that you might be too hard on yourself and your body image. Talk to a psychologist to work through your view and expectations of yourself. You tell me you're 5'7\" and 120-130? That's a good bodyweight for a girl of that height.

            "I\u2019ve had a similar experience I did a muscle up and severely strained it. Couldn\u2019t do a pull up for 7 months.  it\u2019s actually a muscle that runs along the tricep down to your lats. It\u2019s involved in a deep stretch when lowering a lat pull down or coming down from a pull up or chin up. I wasn\u2019t able to do lat pull downs or pull ups but I was able to do chin ups over time which was wierd all because of a different grip. \n\nSince your a novice it\u2019s only natural to expect your body is not accustomed to working out and or certain stretches and movements. Until you build yourself up and work on stretching and mobility exercises and recovery and trial and error you\u2019ll run into injuries at the gym.\n\nSince your able to workout I suspect it\u2019s just a muscle strain. Dont do exercises that put trauma or tension on it that can cause pain. Let it recover. Light stretches. Sleep. Eat. Sauna and relax. Work around that certain area.\n\nIf it\u2019s red bruised or swollen it\u2019s a muscle tear which can take 1-3 months to repair. If it hurts you and causes pain in your everyday life then you gotta call a doctor but a light to moderate strain will recover on its and repair within 2-3 weeks 4 max if it\u2019s not severe. It\u2019s just a pain to deal with."

Take them as you see fit:\n\nDo you really need to be training 5 days a week in your first two years? 5 days is probably the upper end of frequency you need to see progress. Training to failure often is unnecessary. Plenty of studies show the opposite. 1-3 reps in reverse for 90% of your training is sufficient given your training age.  \n\nHow are you counting your calories? Are you using an app? Also 2200 kcal is a pretty large surplus given your stats. 150g of protein is way too much protein. Most recommendations of protein intake are between .7-1g per lb of bodyweight. There are people double your bodyweight that grow muscle just fine with those protein intakes. \n\nOvercoming something like anorexia is a huge success but because you were in an underfeed state, the majority of the weight gain initially won't be muscle. The human body is in no rush to put on muscle. \n\nYour progress is no where close to where it should be compared to what? Compared to your efforts? Sorry if I'm coming across rude but I think you are over-estimating the amount of progress you should be making. \n\nI am also I am getting the feeling that are getting information for a mostly intermediate-advanced male audience. A gallon of water is way too much for you. Let's compare that to someone like me. I'm 260 lbs and train 6-8 times a week and even a gallon of water is too much for me. \n\n10k steps a day is a lot and will cause you to burn too many calories for you to be in a net surplus. \n\n25% body fat is not a whooping amount of body fat for a female. Are you Olympic marathon runner level lean? No but you are not unreasonably high. \n\nWhat were your stats before all this? Did you consider that you've already made great progress?\n\nSorry again if I came across rude. Hope any of this help. If it is an underlying sickness or hormone issue, I hope you are able to get the treatment you deserve.",

I\u2019m very experienced with properly tracking macros and use MyFitnessPal. Even on my highest bulking calories, my coach never pushed me to gain more than around 0.5lb/per week. Before cutting, my maintenance was around 2000kcal.\n\nI drink a gallon of water easily and dont feel the need to push myself to get water in. I also take creatine which increases my water intake.\n\nI felt my progress was insignificant based off both physical qualities and strength qualities. For example, I\u2019ve been plateaued in almost all of my lifts for months now. Given, I was doing a mini cut earlier this year. Despite this, I well hoped to, after 2 years of very consistent training, be able to squat a plate (which I am unable to do). \n\nAll in all, I feel frustrated. Comparison is the thief of joy.

If you so, what can you squat for 2 reps? 3 reps? 10 reps? 14 reps? What about for 3x10? 5x5? 4x8?. In terms of strength progression, there are so many different thresholds that can illicit an adaption. Probably time to follow a more advanced style of periodization. You can go researching down that rabbit hole. Just promise me your head wont spin after trying to understand it all. Also just because you can't right now, doesnt mean you got weaker. You're preparedness might just be down and that ok. Usain Bolt can't run a world record 100m once a week every week for the rest of his life. Be grateful for every personal record you get. Even if is adding 5 lbs to you 14 rep max on an isolation exercise. \n\n  \nNext. Is there a reason for these minicuts? How much weight are you losing during these minicuts? If you're not losing much, then that is just maintaining. If you're really having trouble gaining lean muscle, then there might be no real reason to do a minicut. A minicut is meant as a short phase to lose some small fat to resensitize  further growth.",

I hoped to cut a little further but the news of my low muscle mass and high body fat percentage led my coach to pull me into maintenance. Right now, she\u2019s aiming to reverse diet me back up to 2000kcals and then push me into a slight surplus to build more lean tissue.

            "It's possible, but you would be the only one doing it that way. Typically arms tend to grow fast, shrink fast, and cap out fast. So one month of training will make the most difference on your biceps, but so will one month off. \n\nOne reason you don't want to JUST do arms is that you won't get much of a hormonal boost from that since arms are small muscles, and a portion of the results you see in the gym are from systemic hormones. So, for example, some guys only do complex exercises and no arms at all, because the hormones carry through to the arms and there is some secondary arm stuff in the complex exercises.\n\nProbably you need to do more sets of arms at higher intensity than you are currently doing. I will say, that if your arms really aren't growing, you can do extra arm stuff at home with a pair of DBs that you pick up every couple hours in order to add another set or two. If I were you, I'd count how many \"to failure\" sets your doing each week for shoulders, triceps and biceps, and try to up it. 15 of each is kind of the very max to bother with unless you are a body builder (3 sets of each shoulders, biceps, triceps, 5x per week)."

During that period, you build muscle even at sub-optimal training, diet, and recovery. However, once you get more experience, the nooby gains wear off and you HAVE TO adhere to the standard rules.\n\nIt's not that hard dude. You weigh 115 lbs, which is 52.3 kg. The muscle building range for protein in 1.2-1.8 g of protein per kg bodyweight. For you, that's ~63-94 g protein a day. That's trivially easy. Get a whey protein powder, those are usually 20-25 g protein per scoop. A 2-scoop shake will get you to 40-50 g. A pound of ground meat, depending on how lean it is, can be anywhere between 80-112 g protein. Split the pound of meat into 4 meals across the day and you'll be either within or exceeding your goal.\n\n>Currently my goal is to get a toned body, kind of like a Bruce Lee body.\n\nThis is a misconception on what \"toned\" means.

Nobody gets up and says hey I\u2019m gonna do a marathon for the first time in my life and never train for it. It\u2019s gonna be brutal for you. \n\nJust rest. Eat enough for recovery. Sleep. And let your body do its thing. It will take a bit longer if your an untrained person. If your rotator cuff is bruised like a black eye or swollen and and very painful to move to the point you will cry that means you tore it.. But if it\u2019s just sore it will repair within time usually in a week if it persist then you should go see a doctor. Could just be a strain as well but that takes more time to heal 2- 4 weeks",

            "bro thanks for letting me know but today (48 hours now) my rotator cuff soreness has subsided almost completely! you are right, i am untrained (8 months only) (most of the time was gone in losing 20kgs so i had trained muscles for only like 2 months and 1 week or smth, therefore my body reacted to this new stimulus. thanks for telling me bro but do you think that i should train them again? (i am just scared of tearing them while performing shoulder overhead press or incline/flat bench press)",
            "yeah bro i was just overstressing it i guess! cuz 48 hours now and the pain has almost subsided! protein and sleep was all i needed! and as far as I know is ice helpful to reduce DOMS after 24 hours? or is it ineffective after 24 hours? thanks for the advice bro!",
            "Hey brah that\u2019s good to hear that the soreness is subsiding. Should be good within the week \ud83d\udc4c \n\nI do recommend training them regularly. The Rotator cuff is a group of muscles plus some tendons and you can\u2019t grow these muscles like a bicep or chest and tendons can\u2019t grow they can get stronger or weaker. So I believe you should train them regularly if not daily with light weight at least 2-3 times a week just to strengthen them. When you get stronger with your lifts your tendons won\u2019t be as strong so if you do end up lifting to heavy the rotator cuff will take a brunt of that load and that\u2019s were injuries happen. \n\nTo prevent them train them to strengthen them. Baby steps tho. Up the weight or reps over a slow period of time. Practice good form with incline and shoulder press don\u2019t try to max out. Warm up your shoulders and rotator cuffs on chest and shoulder day and you will be good bro.\n\nYou never start up a car in dead winter in -40 degree weather and start driving. you always let it run and warm up. That\u2019s the same with your body. Warm up. Let the blood flow. It will prevent chances of injuries if your body is fortified \ud83d\udcaa\n\nYou can try doing dumbbells with 1-5lbs they don\u2019t provide as much resistance as cables but you can start with 2lbs or something or use a resistance band. \n\nBut if you keep doing em they will strengthen and thus you won\u2019t be sore anymore so you just gotta keep at it but you know your body so you may want to ease into it. But in the future 5lbs will be light weight I do up to 20lbs on cables but I had to build up strength over a long period of time so my body could adapt to it"

It looks like there\u2019s a cover so you can put a dumbbell on the machine either. The following are some alternatives.\n\nYou can try: Higher reps, doing the exercise later in the workout (weakened by fatigue), possibly adding in a pause in the stretch, slowing your eccentrics/adding control, increasing your ROM, doing them single arm/leg if feasible.\n\nAside from that, it may be worth switching gyms if that\u2019s an option for you, especially if you really like these machines. Most gyms have a regular pin hole, so a GymPin would become an option. Given this proprietary system, it\u2019s unlikely any company comes out with an extension.\n\nLooking at it again though, couldn\u2019t you sandwich a GymPin between two of the plates? So, select 80lbs, put the pin down, lower the weight. Then select 190 and add your weight as needed. The stack might compress the pin from both sides, holding it in place. Of course, test this with just the empty pin to make sure it\u2019s secure. Proceed at your own risk (and to gym property)."

I think the overall routine looks good, so maybe the issue of less progress isn't the frequency or showing up at the gym, but it might be HOW you train. Make sure to train with a lot of effort and intensity, and maybe add a day of resistance training which focuses on your weaknesses. Choose exercises properly (I recommend Dr. Mike Israetel or Renaissance Periodiziation) and make sure form is perfect. Realistically with your diet and cardio program, you should be golden, especially if you are sticking to it, so just focusing on really pushing progression in the weight room.\n\nProgressing in resistance training is by far the BEST way to change body composition and aesthetics, as well as feel stronger and healthier. It's good to see you're using all types of cardio (longer duration, endurance and shorter, high intensity) but if you can ramp it up with the weight training, you have the golden ticket to a healthy, great looking physique.",

The caloric restrictions are in place to help ensure I eat food that is more nutritionally dense and guarantee fat loss (lots of beans, rice, eggs, low fat meat, etc.) Saturday is a cheat day and I usually eat my maintenance calories (usually around 2.2k to 2.4k). After my weight loss journey, I feel like I have that portion down but I still have the deposits of visceral fat on my stomach from years and years of eating processed food.\n\nI really like your suggestion on replacing the ab workouts with mobility training.

(Primary goal is to lose the stomach/visceral fat, gaining muscle is secondary)\n\nIn the past 5 weeks it has been bizarre because I have not really *lost* any weight, but I have become stronger. On average, I can lift roughly 20-40% more weight (same number of sets, every set aiming for failure) than I did in my first week of working out. I just assumed I should have lost a decent sum of weight with the caloric deficit I have, but it does not seem to be the case.\n\nI track calories burned through my fitbit (though conservatively because I know that it tends to overestimate). I take any calories burned over 3k with a grain of salt, but I would imagine on average I'm burning at least 3k a day while being active. As a result, I cap my calories at 2.2k to be safe. Only once a week do I go over and eat more, and that is on Saturday.\n\nAre these normal results for a beginner? Are there other variables I'm not considering?",

Which is a little bit more than other muscle groups. This is mostly because I find it harder to hit peak intensity with core work.",
            "For a balanced diet considering your macros a good starting point is around 40-50% carbs, 30-35% fats, and 20-30% protein. Adjust based on how your body responds. \n\n\n\nAnd yes it is possible to gain some muscle while burning fat esp for beginners. This is referred to as body recomposition. Key here is to maintain slight calorie deficit while esnuring you get enough protein.\n\n\n\nIt is not uncommon for beginners to see strength gains without significant weight lost initially. This can be due to gaining muscle mass while losing fat, which might not reflect much change on the scale but will show in measurements and in clothes. Maybe track not just your weight but also your body measurements and body fat percentage. And dont forget about rest and recovery this is essential for any gains."

Excessive bench pressing can cause pain in this region, and even extreme stretch movements which your body isn't used to like flyes, dips can also cause this. \n\nContraction-based movements are probably the best for mitigating this, try them out for a bit and go back to free weights with lower load and see the difference!"

            "It's great but it is missing any isolation movements. I think a lot of muscles are neglected here, so maybe I can improve it. Isolation movements are also really quick to do, 3 sets might take you 6-10 mins max, so adding a couple in there each workout could be the move. The key to changing body composition and looking better is resistance training combined with consistent cardio, so the cardio part looks pretty good, just make sure your diet is in check and fat loss will come if you're in a caloric deficit (track your calories and weight regularly)\n\nOn Day 1: Add an exercise of triceps as well, maybe skullcrushers or tricep pushdowns, and add some kind of lateral raise too. The arms and shoulders are very important for looking good, so I think adding something like that could be a game changer.\n\nOn Day 2: Same applies, the back movements are good and cardio is great, but I would recommend some bicep and rear delt exercises to really top of your physique. This way you won't find your arms to be lagging behind your physique and it will take really short time to just do some curls and superset them with rear delt work. \n\nOn Day 3: I would reduce the cardio time for this, so you aren't fatigued when you get to the weight training which heavily involves legs, or you can put the cardio after as well. For this one, I would recommend doing Barbell Squats (as you are) and a hip hinge movement to target the lower back, glutes and hamstrings too. For this, the romanian deadlift (with dumbbells since you are a novice) is going to be amazing. Especially if you have a desk job, the lower back can grow very weak due to limited use and movement, so adding some hip hinges like RDLs can do the trick, just make sure your form is perfect and you can build your posterior chain (back side) of your body equally well as your front.",

To try and lift most every day... but briefly.  This makes it more of a consistent habit plus makes it easier to remember what I last worked on.  I head to my garage gym around the same time every day.  I do one exercise (such as the bench press) for about 3 sets, depending on what I'm doing and how I'm feeling, and then I'm done for the day.  Next day, another muscle group (such as lat rows).  I have 7 unique exercises I rotate thru, never working same general muscle group back to back, for about 6-8 weeks.  Then come up with a variation of that theme for the next 6-8 weeks.  Seems to work well.  Moderate gains, no injuries... except I may be fatiguing my hands/forearms as most weight lifting involves gripping a bar or handle.  Question: Am I not giving hands/forearms recovery time and asking for trouble, or am I overthinking that it's even an issue?  I don't use extreme amounts of weight.  Thanks, Pat",

So for more than 6 months since I started going to the gym I had been following this workout routine from a YouTube channel. Two weeks ago on my leg day I was doing 8 sets of 12-15 barbell squats n 6 sets of lunges. It was kind of the same routine for 6 weeks atleast. Now, last week after realising my body hadn't changed that much since I started gym, I asked the gym trainer to tell me the routines i should follow since the YouTube ones aren't working for me. So on leg day he told me to do 4 sets of each exercise- barbell squats, lunges, leg press, extension n curl. However this time when I tried to do it with the same weight it was hard. I didn't know what was happening. All i remember is I did do my core exercise one day before leg day. So for a moment I thought maybe the little pain in my lower abdomen from those exercises is making me feel weak. But to go from 8 sets to hardly being able to do 4 was so weird. My technique hadn't changed, my meal was the same then why suddenly this weakness? Then even weird thing happened. I hadn't felt this level of soreness after a leg day in weeks n suddenly I feel the same kind of soreness that i felt when I first started going to the gym. This is the second week of my trainer's routine. Today is my leg day again. So let's see if I can do this n if the soreness comes back.",

            "How tall are you? Your 154lbs. If you have love handles then you may need to get yourself in an uncomfortable position for a long period of time. If you want to have a flat stomach you may have to cut down to the low 140lbs. You gotta do it right and it will take time probably 8 months to a year done right and consistently. \n\nThe reason why you shouldn\u2019t cut at a young age is because you should be taking advantage of these younger years for growth but hey you gotta do what you gotta do get rid of the love handles. From there you need to do a nice clean lean bulk so your love handles don\u2019t jump right back",
            "First off, if you are 186 cm and 70kg, then you probably don't need to cut, and probably need more muscle. Second, you are at the age where if you lift a lot and simply work on muscle growth you can lose fat at the same time - I really don't think males in puberty should be cutting at all unless they are above say 25% body fat.\n\nI recommend maintaining weight, lifting more, eating more protein and cutting processed food. This will lose you body fat and gain muscle, which will impact your love handles.\n\nI think you need to accept that different bodies keep their fat in different places and the only thing you can really focus on is having enough muscle and reducing body fat. The best body fat estimate not from dexa is to measure your waist and put it into an online calculator. Basically every cm you lose of your waist roughly correlates to 1% bodyfat. It would be very useful to know what your bodyfat percentage is in order to help you.\n\nIf you do cut, and I don't recommend in part because you could slow down your growth spurts and height, then definitely don't do more than 1kg per week. Personally I don't do more than .5kg per week.",

            "Damn ur tall dude 6\u20190 your like underweight. Not sure if you have bad case of body dysmorphia which is very prevelant with social media comparing bodies, Best of the best. Unless ur overweight you\u2019ll want to take the time from ages 15 - 20 and do a slow lean bulk\n\nYou might not even have love handles. But to answer your question you want a nice slow cut because the quicker you cut the more you will dip into your muscle tissue being burned as a result of a quick cut.\n\nI bulked for 5 years before i did my first cut i went from 196lb to 152lb too quickly. I went from benching 225lb to 165lb sure i had abs but I was weak as fuuuark.\n\nSo some homework of the day. Go log all your lifts bench, squat, deadlift, bicep curl etc that way you have a baseline of your current strength as you are now. I guarantee you if you cut to quick you\u2019ll be weaker in strength in all those lifts. \n\nRemember building muscle takes time.. months\u2026 but it can be obliterated quickly within weeks. (Worst case scenario)\n\nNo special diet. Eat lots of fibre. Greens, high protein. Complex carbs. Yams, potatoes. Rice is fine whether brown or white. Small deficit nothing to major you want to lose 0.1 - 1 pound a week. The slower the better. That way you save muscle tissue from being burned.\n\nYou\u2019ll have decide do you want your love handles gone or do you want to sacrifice strength. Of course you can have both to an extent but you can\u2019t do a rush job on it. Imagine building a house in 3 months that shit would crumble.",
            "Thanks again for the help it\u2019s just weird because my friend weighs the exact same as me and we both are equally strong and he doesn\u2019t have love handles.  \nBut do you think it\u2019s a good idea to just build strength until I\u2019m a little older and then cut?",
            "Unfortunately that\u2019s genetics for yah. You and your friend don\u2019t have the same mom and dad. Y\u2019all have different genetics aka attributes, strengths and weaknesses even if your the same race. \n\nYour younger years are the best years for building muscle and strength because your hormones will be through the roof your body can recover quicker and digest food easier than an older dude. So yah build strength now cut and trim the fat off later just don\u2019t go full retard on the bulk and over eat and get lazy.\n\nWhen your older you\u2019ll have less free time as well.

Since I was too young at the time, my parents didn't plan on doing the surgery. Then fast forward to 11th grade, you guys know how it is, social anxiety, reduced interactions with people, feeling awkward all the time cuz additionally I had joined a new school. Standing in awkward positions when forced to stand, being called weird, wearing overcoats when going to class, not feeling to exercise chests because for some time I had done pushups and it had become worse a long time ago, since then I haven't even tried to workout.

For example: for flat bench, once you\u2019re able to do 4 sets of 8 with a certain weight, increase by 5lbs. Then you\u2019ll be right on track. You should never just be focused on sets/reps. The focus is progression. This is how you make gains and what will separate you and the guys who been hitting the gym and looking the same for years. \n\nAs far as your specific routine, lots of junk volume for someone who\u2019s a beginner. As I said earlier, consistency & progressive overload > everything else. You can get rid of the dumbbell flys if you\u2019re already benching heavy twice a week. No need for two isolation exercises for triceps. Same with biceps. Your leg day is good on both days. Overall the program is solid. Very solid. Again, once you stop progressing, you\u2019ll need to start eating. Again, another separator here. If you don\u2019t start eating you will stop progressing at this point, unless you hop on gear. \n\nFeel free to PM me if need be.\n\nHere\u2019s a video of me benching 375 for 1rm a year ago. I\u2019m at 390 now and I squat 520 for a 1rm. \n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/HONcrP6oWFM?si=hpPZI3k1ZIHFa9t3",
            "Agree with above. Consistency is the key. Probably don't do a dedicated ab day (abs are about body fat mostly). As far as volume goes, generally people max out at between 10-15 hard sets per body part per week, but this can go up for seasoned lifters and athletes, or down for people who are new to lifting. Junk volume is volume where you've hit your max gains and keep going.\n\nIts also focus on protein, minimal processed food and sleep instead of super optimizing the exact workout (assuming you are getting your hard sets in)."

I'd swap leg press or leg extensions out for a glute movement like Lunges personally. I also don't train calves so I would swap them out for another Hamstring movement, probably RDLs.

And you\u2019ll say hey I\u2019m not jacked I don\u2019t have a lot of muscle. Everyone has muscle. It\u2019s the reason why you can pick stuff up and do day to day activities and go to work and sit up straight. Lean muscle tissue gives structure. It gives tone. It gives definition. It gives strength.\n\nExcessive weight loss will result in loose, flabby and saggy skin you\u2019ll end of weaker as well with the result of burning some muscle tissue in the process. I knew a girl  that was 200lbs and she was 5\u20199 all she did was run and extreme dieted she dropped to 130lb her face slimmed down and she looked good. But she had left over flabby skin from the extreme weight loss and no structure to her body. \n\nSince your not doing anything crazy you won\u2019t see a crazy drop in weight. Go extreme and you\u2019ll drop extreme weight. Go nice and slow and you\u2019ll drop weight nice and slow.\n\nSorry but it\u2019s a long process a journey. The weight you accumulated over the years can\u2019t be dropped over night. Just as the weight gain wasn\u2019t done over night as well.

            "I would definitely cut. There is no benefit to bulking beyond around 20%bf as you will then just have to cut for longer and having more bodyfat starts to negatively impact health. \nMuscle retention should not be a big issue as long as you eat plenty of protein and continue working out hard and don\u2019t cut too hard or for too long as I will describe next. Whatever you loose you will hopefully gain back within the first 1-2 months of the next bulk. \n\nDon\u2019t go too fast, around 0.4-0.75% bodyweight per week is optimal for a sustainable weight loss and do it for 2-3 months at first and then have a break for around two weeks where you eat at maintenance and workout less to recover properly.\nAfter that you can choose what to do next: can you continue with another cut without it being too psychologically draining? Then do another two months.\nIf not then have a month long maintenance phase to really reduce diet and training fatigue and then continue then cut afterwards.\n\nI would not go for a bulk unless you are around 16% bf or less or unless when you look in the mirror you say to yourself: \u201cI am very happy with my level of bodyfat and in fact I will still feel comfortable even if I put on a bit more.\u201d\n\nIn short: If I were you I would focus on fat loss, do a cut then maintain for a month then another cut and then another maintenance before starting a serious bulk around mid-late autumn and bulk until mid-late spring with a maintenance phase or a mini-cut in the middle of the bulk.\nBy the same time next year you will be significantly leaner and have more muscle at the same time.\n\nGood luck on your fitness journey and feel free to reach out with any further questions.",

            "A few critiques. \n\nFirst, this is just preference, but I'd switch 5x5s for a higher rep range like your isolation work. You can make the same gains for each rep range, as long as you're training intensely and close to failure. I think it's easier to achieve this in the 8-20 rep range. Training close to failure in the lower rep ranges always fatigues my CNS too much. Also, I think the risk of injury is higher in the lower rep ranges because of the load required to train intensely and close to failure. \n\nSecond, you're missing hamstrings and glutes. You will get a bit of glute activation on your squats, but not enough, IMO. I'd throw in 8-10 sets(weekly) of lunges and RDLs. The calves are optional, IMO. \n\nThirdly, I would swap out shoulder press entirely and replace it with bench. If you can move your bench to an incline position, it's even better. This will hit your front delts and your entire chest. I would also add 8-10 sets(weekly) of DB lateral raises. You will get some activation on any pulling movement in your rear delts, but you could also consider adding some isolation sets for them as well.",

First, you shouldn't be taking more than a few minutes between sets unless you are doing hardcore strength training (like olympic lifters for example). If you have some reason to take that long, and they ask about a machine, you should let them work in since you have the time. You shouldn't be talking on your phone or texting either if someone is waiting.  \n  \nSecond, if you are supersetting a different excercise (or even 2), you should def offer to let them work in, or you should stop the superset and finish the other exercise after you've finished the machine they want. \n\nOtherwise, just let it go. Gyms are a little like angry driving... normal people get all pissy and frustrated when the machine they were about to use gets taken first, but its not anyones fault."

I'd aim for 4-5 days per week for a while.  \n2. You should eat a maintenance amount of calories or a slight surplus depending on your goals and whether you are going to cheat a little (ie if you find yourself cheating, aim for maintenance). The best way to do this is to first use an online calculator, then track calories, weight and waist circumference each day.  Each additional cm of your waist is basically about 1% body fat, and so you want to gain weight slow enough that your waist line doesn't expand. Generally speaking 1 lb per week is the maximum weight gain... this represents 3600 calories above your weekly maintenance calorie amount.  \n3. Make sure to eat lots of protein, .8g per lb, very little processed foods, and get lots of sleep (for hormones).\n\nThose are the big ones. There are other tweaks, but those are the things that count if you aren't taking steroids. The risk here is NOT that you won't gain muscle, its that you gain back to much fat. Remember, your body \"wants\" to return to a higher body fat percentage, not a higher weight, so its hard to keep the fat off.",

I do a push/pull/legs routine, but full body is also a good routine as well. It is up to how you want to workout those muscle groups. I would recommend somehow implementing calf raises with your legs. I would also be careful with doing too much in the day as well. Experiment with different routines as well. And don\u2019t get discouraged with not seeing results for a bit. It took a while for me to see some results and get into a routine that works with me. \n\nFor getting the protein in, with your body weight shouldn\u2019t be too difficult. Some sources say even .7-1 gram per pound is effective in muscle growth. Lean ground beef, chicken, turkey, or fish (salmon/tuna) is good for meats. Protein powders are pretty effecting in helping filling the gaps and you don\u2019t have to only use them in shakes. You could mix them with pancake batter to make protein pancakes. I would sometimes mix a scoop or two with some Greek yogurt to get protein in quickly. And I understand that protein powders can be pricey, but a good option. Eggs are great and they can be pretty cheap too. Cottage cheese can be a good snack for protein as well. Lentils if you want to go something other than meat and it has iron and potassium in it. With lentils there are black beans, and chickpeas too! Quinoa would be great with chicken or fish. There are a lot of options out there for getting protein in without spending too much money or time on it. But I feel like the most important part of it is making sure that you give these foods seasoning/flavor because it will make eating miserable in my option. \n\nGood luck! And great job on taking that first step and having a plan.",

Your goal should be something like eating the foods needed to gain muscle. Or doing more research on how muscles grow bigger. Eat the right foods, follow a planned and timed workout but don't expect to keep up right away. Let yourself adjust to a planned workout with time restraints.

        "responses": [
            "With trainers I think there's a double edged sword. If someone is new to fitness the most important thing to do is establish a regular training habit. Once you have the habit established it's easier to be consistent. If you struggle with motivation to workout going hard right out of the gate is a good way to associate exercise with unpleasant feelings and it will be easy to quit. That said people want to feel like they're getting their money's worth from a trainer and they want fast results to justify their expenditure. \n\nThere's also a contingent of people in fitness who are mostly noob or intermediate lifters who will say \"never go to failure.\" It's mostly bullshit imo. Sure it's not absolutely necessary to go to failure to make progress but part of going near failure is knowing what failure feels like imo.\n\nAll that said if you're losing motivation to train and don't like the trainers style either tell them or find another trainer. Don't give up. Regular exercise doesn't have to be painful. Sure there's discomfort but it should be fleeting. You should feel good after a workout not like you're going to puke. It does take time to adapt though. You can do that quickly or incrementally.",
            "Thanks man, i dont feel like i need to puke. Actually we did hvae one more workout but at that one i felt the need to puke super fast - so he listened to me and we syopped, i actually enjoy those workouts we had after the first one i just needed to make sure its okay that it happens",
            "I think it's fine as long as your trainer listens to you and you're not losing motivation. The single most important thing about being in shape is consistency. In the first 6 months to a year of training you really want to nail down consistency. Getting beyond that 3-4 month mark is the challenge. I think a lot of people worry about results early on and there's nothing wrong with thinking about results and progress but the way I see it you need to train your brain to require regular physical activity.\n\n As someone who has been active and fit my whole adult life I've never found it hard to motivate myself to exercise regularly even when I was doing construction in hot ass Florida summers 8-10 hours a day. At that point I was programmed to be active. I couldn't just sit around the house all weekend and do nothing. I've switched up the focus over the years though I've gone from martial arts and running to calisthenics to kettlebell to strength training and hypertrophy training. \n\nYou have your whole life to train and you can always increase intensity slowly over time but if you don't build the habit going hard for 6 months will do little for you if you quit and spend the next 5 years sitting on your ass eating."

Since I've hurt my back my next biggest fear became potentially hurting my knees.\n\nSince I am experiencing this with 10 pounds on both sides, should I continue with 10 to help strengthen my knees with that weight, or should I stick to no weight since that doesn't cause problems? I could go higher too...\n\nMy only other question, I can do a normal squat without plates with no weight fine, it seems like I only have an issue with form when I add weight, that's mainly why I started adding plates under my heels. It's a little frustrating because I know I can squat more, but to avoid injury I'm just doing less than I can to strengthen areas that might get injured first...and of course practice my form as I add weight.",

I'd stick with a weight that doesn't cause pain for 3 weeks then try adding a top set with a heavier weight and then the rest of your sets with lighter weight. If you recover from the workout with the heavy top set and don't have pain do your top set and a second set with the new weight."

It hasn't always been easy but I try to keep my health at the forefront of my thoughts as motivation to keep going. \nYou're gonna do great.

Walking and running up to a MAF pace but no higher is probably the best.\n\nAlso for cardio you don't have to run. Consider rowing on a rowing machine. It will be a lot easier on your joints. I would keep the intensity low and see how long you can push the sessions on a rower. Listen to a podcast and see if you can make it for 30 mins straight, then up the time.\n\nMAF heart rate is 180-age. You can look up the MAF method if you want it's well known."

I've struggled a lot with consistency throughout that time as I'm sure we all have but more recently I've had to take 5-6 months off for personal reason and now I'm trying to get back to where I was physically. Now yes I'm aware that I'd be weaker after that time anyway and for the most part I have been, for example I can't do as many sets or reps compared to what I used to be able to, I'm perfectly aware of how that all works. However my first training session back I trained my chest, shoulders and triceps and for a few days afterwards they were quite sore and I expected they would be. After the soreness went away I tried doing the same workout today and my shoulders and triceps are performing I little better than what they did they other day which is what I expected but my pecs were significantly weaker. Now I'm decently strong in general even without training but now I can barely move the weights. For example the first time I trained my chest when I first came back I could do around 15-20 reps of pec flys or dumbell presses but now I can barely do 1-3 reps of either exercise with the same weight and throughout my years of training I've taken time off before but I've never experienced something like this. I did what I could but I couldn't even get a pump in my chest which is usually very easy for me. Yesterday and the day before this I did feel a slight tightness going across my upper chest going from shoulder to shoulder when I stretched my arms out but I thought that was just because I had trained it for the first time after so long off.

If you are training as a strength athlete (sets of 1-5 reps) then you need 2-3 days of full body recovery per week but it's complicated and hopefully you would have some science backed training strategy and coach. For most gymgoers you don't actually need 48 hours recovery, it's more a matter of time management. You have a certain number of sets for a given body part per week and you want to distribute them throughout the week in a way that maximises performance.

            "The universal \u201cgoods\u201d for physique are lifting weights, cutting processed foods and alcohol, staying active, eating lots of protein and getting sleep.\n\nI highly recommend lifting weights, and doing it in a progressive overload manner. This along with protein (protein doesn\u2019t help much if you don\u2019t lift), will ensure that when you gain weight, you gain mostly muscle, and when you lose weight you mostly lose fat. Over time this results in a lower body fat percentage which is the goal for most people. \n\nBeyond that, eating less calories is how you weigh less total. Processed foods mess with your appetite signaling, and metabolism and cause you to overeat even months later, which is why you cut it. Lack of sleep causes the same.  Beyond that, you have to find what works for you personally in terms of not eating too much. I like to cook 3lbs of chicken, broccoli and quinoa each Sunday and eat that for all my \u201cat home\u201d meals for the week. Since I put each meal in its own container, it\u2019s hard to accidentally overeat. I also make sure not to have bad foods or delicious snacks in the house. \n\nA lot of people also benefit from weighing themselves everyday and restricting something regarding food (carbs, or calories, or time restricted eating). If you choose time restricted eating, you really need to double down on the protein aspects of it, because people on those types of diets eat way too little protein and don\u2019t retain muscle as well."

            "The video is about losing tension at the end of the concentric phase where as you are talking about losing tension at the end of the eccentric phase and these are different questions. The current science (e.g. [https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2017/09000/hypertrophic\\_effects\\_of\\_concentric\\_vs\\_\\_eccentric.31.aspx](https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/fulltext/2017/09000/hypertrophic_effects_of_concentric_vs__eccentric.31.aspx) and references) is that a full range of motion in the eccentric phase maximises hypertrophy, so that would be the bottom of a squat or the fully lowered position in a bicep curl. The other question is whether you need a full ROM in the concentric phase, i.e. whether partial reps in the lengthened position are also hypertrophic and there's plenty of research (e.g. https://journal.iusca.org/index.php/Journal/article/view/182) to suggest that you can go partial ROM when you are fatigued beyond the ability to complete the concentric because stretching under load is so effective at building muscle. This would be like doing a bicep curl but not bringing the bicep fully to your torso but getting a full stretch on the bicep at the bottom of each rep, or doing squats to full depth but not locking out at the top. So if you are going to skip ROM, skip it at the end of the concentric not the eccentric phase",
            "Thank you for the clarification, although I am still not able to accurately communicate my point.\nWhenever I squat, I go through the whole range of motion without loosing tension, until I reach the lowest position in the squat.\nThen I usually un-tense my muscles, catch a breath and go upwards\nMy doubt is whether my muscles should always be tense throughout the entire squat, or if I am loosing gains whenever I lose tension at the bottom (for a second or two).",
            "You should never breathe at the bottom of a squat. If you're going to pause at the bottom, take a breath in at the top and exhale as you stand up, not while you're pausing. Pausing at the bottom of a squat, like pausing at the bottom position of a bicep curl gets rid of the stretch reflex which would allow you to go heavier or do more reps. It's recommended with isolation exercises such as bicep curls to pause at the end of the eccentric phase and feel a full stretch, but with compound exercises like squats or bench press which are more fatiguing pausing is optional. If you are squatting with weight then you will be able to heavier weight without the pause.",

        "responses": [
            "Hey,\n\nDeadlift is a great posterior chain movement (whole back side) that targets pretty much every muscle in the body. I would recommend doing your deadlifts on leg day since it really fatigues your body and central nervous system. This way you'll have more energy for your actual back training movements, like barbell row and pull up. Now that we are talking about fatigue, your back and biceps day contains a lot of volume, which might be hindering your progress. I personally like to do 2-3 back exercises and 1-2 bicep exercises on my pull day, and focus on making your sets more intense. From my experience I've found that this much volume means only two things:\n\n1. The exercises are not challenging enough which leaves your muscles unstimulated. The annoying part is also that you'll be spending more time in the gym than you would have to. By increasing instensity, you save time and feel way better since you concentrated on every set.\n\n2. The exercises are way too challenging. This usually happens when people first start going to the gym. It feels great for the first few weeks, until a wall hits in their face. At this point the workouts feel too grueling and not enjoyable at all. This discourages having a consistent gym routine.\n\nTo sum it all up, you should remove deadlifts from you back day and move it to leg day. Also, consider removing few exercises and replace them with more intense sets. I would personally remove One Arm Dumbbell Rows and Seated Cable Rows from your back exercises. From bicep exercises I would remove Concentration Curl and maybe Seated Dumbbell Curl if you're feeling fatigued. \n\nHope this helps! Feel free to contact me if you have more questions. You got this!",

            "Don't do the last two... they are bad ideas, especially laxatives. They don't care how much you weigh, just how you look.  \n\n\nThe explaining of this is complicated because you can lose fat in 2 weeks, then you can do things that just make you look better. Its complicated because they influence each other and measurement. I'll start with body fat loss: Try to lose no more than 4 lbs of weight in 2 weeks, which means eating 1000 less calories per day than you normally do. I assume you are eating about 1800 calories a day basted on gender/weight, so you are going to want to roughly cut your calories in half for two weeks. You will also want to MAKE SURE you get 100+ grams of protein each day so you lose fat and not muscle...  you are already losing weight at twice the normal speed so if you don't load protein you will lose muscle instead of fat. Finally you'll want to do strength training, either lifting or body weight work. Cardio is better than nothing. this preserves muscle as well. Honestly, you can't really hurt yourself by eating too few calories for 2 weeks... People fast that long... but you will lose more muscle and less fat the more extreme you go.  \n\n\nThe looks aspect: You want to get a good tan in the next two weeks. You want to cut down on carbs, but the thing about this is that it will cause a couple pounds of water weight loss, because carbs cause water retention, so if you cut out most carbs you might lose 5 lbs your first week, but 2-3 lbs will be body weight (this doesn't count towards your 4lbs max fat loss). Then you want to add the carbs back in 2-3 days before the audition so that your muscles get a pumped look (yes you gain the water weight back, but it effects your muscle size not your waist line). Finally, a lot of people stop drinking much water about 24 hours before the competition, but have some handy in case you need it.\n\nSo\n\n* Cut calories in half and make it almost all protein and some fat with minimal carbs\n* Lots of loaded exercise like lifting\n* Tan\n* Add lots of carbs back in 2-3 days before\n* Stop drinking water a day before"

            "I mean a big reason bodybuilders increment through weight increases instead of rep increases, is that their volume would be so high as to not be sustainable if they were doing as many reps as they would need to increase size/strength. You can get the same size increase from a 30 rep set as a 8 rep set, but it takes 3.5x as long. So its not surprising that too much volume is your issue here.\n\nThat being said, there are a couple rules of volume you want to avoid breaking\n\n1. Too much stress on single muscle group - if you stress out a single muscle group beyond a certain point, you are no longer getting any gains from it. Most people put this around 15 hard sets per week\n2. Too much systemic stress (overtraining) - If you work out too much generally (cardio included), your hormones will plumet and you'll be tired all the time and eventually feel like sick and need sustained rest. This is specific to the person and usually you can feel it coming on (and adjust) unless you are a true animal in the gym.\n3. Too much time in the gym - This is the biggest for me... I just don't want to spend all my time working out. People who start huge time commitment workouts rarely sustain them.  \n\n\nI think I probably wouldn't do any glutes stuff because you already have split squats which hit glutes directly, and leg exercises that indirectly hit it. I would drop this for reason #1 unless you are still under 15 sets per week of squats and glutes AND you really value them.  \n\n\nBeyond that, i think you can add as much calves, abduction and adduction as you could reasonably want... just be careful about not burning yourself out time wise or physically. A good test for systemic stress overtraining is if you have two days in the gym in a row where you feel like crap. At that point, rest day or 1-4 deload days are important.",

One major one is that you can only really put on muscle in a calorie surplus, so if you go to the gym all the time, but only eat enough to maintain your weight, then you won't put on much muscle.  \n\n\nAim to get 1g of protein per day. This is super important. The amount of protein you get basically determines if your body burns fat or muscle when it needs calories. Stop eating processed foods including processed sugar. These cause you to overeat later so they kill your bf percentage.  \n\n\nUnsustainable Improvements: If you just want to look good for July, its possible to lose up to 1lb per week of body fat through a cut, where 70-90% of weight loss is fat. The percentage that is fat goes up as you lose less per week though, so losing .5lbs per week is more efficient bf wise, but less efficient time wise. If I were you, I probably would focus on the sustainable stuff, but if you really want to cut and get lean for july, then start now and aim to lose .5lbs per week. You need to weigh yourself everyday, track your calories in all meals and after a week or two, you can do the math to see how many calories you burn per day (eg you lost 1 lb over two weeks and you ate 2500 calories, then your maintenance calories are 2750 per day). At that point, aim to eat 250 calories less than what you burn each day (2500 in the example). This will mean that you are likely to lose 10 lbs over the next 5 months or 20 weeks. It should be close to 90% fat if you are doing all the things you talked about (gym time). This puts you at 156lbs and 15% body fat (so probably some visible abs) by july.  \n\n\nAlternatively, if you don't think you can do all the diet stuff for 5 months, then start 2.5 months out and lose 1lb per month instead of .5lbs per month. If you've never cut, its pretty brutal on your energy levels though.",
            "Note that if you cut how many carbs you are eating, you will often lose water weight. This can mess up the maintenance calories calculation process, so try to maintain how many carbs you are eating for that.",

I\u2019ve mainly been doing weightlifting, I get a decent amount of cardio in everyday naturally so I leave that where it\u2019s at. I\u2019ve been tracking my calories a lot more as of late and have a rough idea of maintenance so have been eating around/just under what that is. I have time and am willing to commit so I will definitely focus more on keeping a good balance and losing the weight over the 5 month period. Sometimes it is a bit hard to keep track of what I\u2019m eating in terms of macros because I eat a lot of home cooked meals but I don\u2019t cook them myself because I spend most of my day working then the gym, so I know that my protein intake could definitely use some help. Do you have any suggestions on changes I can make that will help those macros and protein intake? I know the usual eat these certain foods but sometimes it\u2019s a bit hard because especially in canada, everything is just so damn expensive it seems like every week I\u2019d have to be spending hundreds of dollars which isn\u2019t the most ideal.

Doing ab exercises does nothing for any fat surrounding your abs. The idea that a given exercise will target and burn fat from a specific area is called \"spot reduction\" and it's widely known to be false. Fat is gained and stored systemically. The only way you can lose fat is systemically by consuming less calories than you burn. Ab exercises can make your abs more visible if you have low body fat. Even so you don't need to do hundreds of repetitions if whether this exercise is. You need to select an exercise where you approach failure between 5 and 30 reps. If you can do over 30 reps that exercise isn't doing much if anything for muscle growth. You also need to focus on progressive overload and increasing difficulty on a weekly basis with any exercise you do with the intent of building muscle or strength.",

The further you are from the wall the harder it is until eventually you're rolling from your knees to completely flat with no wall. If you ever get around to getting one I can explain in more detail.\n\nThat said, I don't do abs at all and I weight train 5 days a week. All of the main compound lifts hit the core and I find that sufficient for me. My stomach is flat and I don't want to diet down more to get to the point where additional ab isolations would be worth the time for me to do it. I'm also super busy though."

Besides genetics here are some things that influence your weight:\n\n\\-How much you ate yesterday. \n\n\\-What foods you ate.\n\n\\-How much sodium you have consumed (sodium makes your body hold on to water which has an effect on your bodyweight).\n\n\\-How hydrated you are.\n\nIn conclusion, 5 to 7lbs fluctuation is totally normal. Some people experience even more extreme changes in their weight. If you want to keep your weigh-ins as constant as possible, you shoul weigh yourself in the morning before eating, and after going to the toilet. This way your stomach and colon will be empty an you'll get more accurate numbers.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that you shouldn't take one day's worth of information as fax.

            "Hey,\n\nSorry to hear that, I know from firsthand experience that muscle imbalances are frustrating and tough to deal with. Heres a few tips I've learned in recent years:\n\n\\-Prioritize unilateral movements. This means training one side at a time, for example a one-arm row. This forces both sides to work equally and you can also do more reps on your left side to catch up. Especially on your left side, focus on great technique and mind muscle connection. Unilateral movements can be used on all bodyparts to reduce imbalances, if for example, one leg gets stronger than the other.  \n\n\\-This tip I recommend for everyone regardless of muscle imbalance. If possible, use mirrors to your advantage. The back is obviously hard to see since it's, well, in the back. Just seeing your muscles flex and seeing yourself perform the exercise increases mind muscle connection significantly. Grab a pair of dumbbells and do one-arm rows infront of a mirror to achieve this. As for myself, I prefer to train by myself but, if possible, a training partner can definitely help. Your partner can stand behind you and give constant feedback of how you're performing.\n\nHope this helps! If you need more help or you have more questions feel free to contact me.

        "responses": [
            "Hey,\n\nSorry to hear about that, I can imagine how frustrating training must be for you. I'm proud of you though for not giving up and doing what you can! That's the right mindset! Here's a few basic things to keep in mind as you're starting.\n\n\\-Keep your intensity relatively low. This goes for every beginner but especially for you so you don't injure yourself. As you're starting to train, keep it easy because your muscles don't need much stimulation to trigger growth. Just go through the movements in order to learn them and increase muscle mind connection. It's important that you don't feel absolutely dead after a workout, that's when you know it's too much. A good, relaxed feeling after a workout is what you want to strive for. \n\n\\-Start with training 2-3 times a week MAXIMUM. Same reasons as before, your muscles don't need much stimulation at first. You need to prioritize resting so you can train fresh everytime. If you're really sore, it's best to take it easy. Once you get more experienced and your muscles recover faster, you can adjust training days and intensity to fit for your liking. Also, find a training split that seems fun for you. The most popular ones are fullbody, upper lower, push pull legs and so on. Honestly, just do what feels best for you. You'll stick to your training program way better if you like how you're training. Otherwise boredom will take over. \n\n\\-Focus on compound exercises. They are big movements that require a lot a lot of muscles to perform. They are great, since they teach your body to move optimally and functionally. In addition, they help you build muscle evenly since pretty much every muscle is working at the same time. If you're training in the gym, try doing bench press, some kind of row, squats, and deadlifts. All of these can be done either with a barbell or a dumbbell. Find out which you prefer. If you're training with your bodyweight try doing push ups, pull ups, bodyweight rows and bodyweight squats. The intensity of these exercises can be adjusted with different angles.  Push ups against a slope or a bench is easier than doing it flat. Same thing for rows, use your legs adjust your angle. Pull ups are difficult as crap and that's why I don't recommend doing them at first. If you're feeling optimistic, you can try doing assisted pull ups with bands or negative pull ups by jumping to the top and resisting the movement on your way down.\n\n\\-Since you want to gain weight I recommend eating high calorie foods. Good quality and naturally fatty foods are for example butter, high fat meat (beef, chicken and fish), high fat dairy and eggs. Also don't be scared of fruits, berries, honey and maple syrup for their high sugar contents, they will definitely help with bulking. Meat is the number one star of your diet since it contains the best quality fat and protein out there. Especially red meat excels in its nutrient density, so don't be scared of it!\n\n\\-Having the right mindset is everything. In my own experience I have found the best success when I focus on how I feel, look and perform. Chasing numbers usually lead me stagnate or do unsustainable routine changes. Of course having goals for numbers is nice and fun, since they are concrete and easy to track, but consider focusing on yourself instead of numbers. It will thank you in the long run. You can take my word for it!\n\nOh wow, that was a lot! Hope my advice is easily understandable and helps you lol. If you have anymore questions, please, feel free to contact me! I'll help as much as I can. Good luck on your journey, you got this man!",
            "I don't disagree with the other post, but I think it emphasizes the wrong stuff.  \n\n\nThe things that matter more than anything else is 1) that you lift weights (bodyweight is ok) a lot, at high intensity (as much as you can without getting sore). 2) you eat more than you are currently eating and make sure to get 80g of protein everyday.   \n\n\nIf you do that, AND part of your lifting is pushups, you'll be great. Everything else is just optimizing for the last 10%",

Well either way, in my experience you can try doing these exercises to failure every day.\n\nSo in your case, you should do 20 situps and pushups as fast as you can. If you can do more, for it. The amount doesn't matter, as long as you do them to absolute failure. I also recommend doing only one set of each exercise, since going to failure every day is exhausting. The goal here is to build a routine for you and train your body to be efficient with these movements. This is because the best way to be better at pushups and situps is to do them lol.\n\nAs for pull ups, try negative pull ups. You can either jump to the top part of pull up or assist yourself with a chair or a rock. Once you get to the top, resist going down as hard as you can. Don't get discouraged, these are hard af, and that's why they're effective. I love negative training for its safety and amazing strength benefits. These will burn like hell but do as many as you can. If it feels hard, just remember you have to do only one set and then it's over. You'll get your first real pull up in no time and after that the results will start pouring in! I also want you to keep in mind that your first pull up will probably look like shit but don't mind that. Our goal here is not to show off, but to create mind to muscle connection.

            "I agree with the first commenter a lot in the sense that the best thing you can do is to do a high volume of the stuff you will be tested on. Additionally, I've done a pullup challenge where I went from 16 pullups to 30 in about a month, so I have some experience. This is what I would do if money was on the line:\n\nI recommend the following pushup/situp workout:\n\n* Repeat 5 times: Do as many pushups as you can in a minute, take a few minutes rest, do as many sits up as you can in a minute, take a few minutes rest.\n* Count up all your situps and pullups for the day and write it down. Do this 2 days in a row then rest a day\n* This isn't ideal for size/strength, but its great for endurance, which is what you are going for.\n\nRunning:\n\n* Day 1: Run 5 miles as fast as you can, Day 2: Run 3 miles quickly, but not as fast as you can, Day 3: Rest Day 4: Run a single mile as fast as you can. Day 5: Run 5 miles quickly, but not as fast as you can. Day 6: Rest\n* Write down all your times. The longer distances are important for improvement in your ability, the single mile run is important in terms of knowing your limits and \"how to run\" your fastest possible mile, so that on race day, you don't go out to fast or too slow.\n\nPullups:\n\nI agree with negative pullups as the best way to start learning. Do lots and lots of volume. The biggest thing you can do to improve pullups is to lose weight, but actively losing weight will hurt your improvement in all other areas since building muscle/strength is dependent on getting enough calories. I would simply do lots of volume of negative pullups, and as you get better, give yourself less and less assistance. EG once you can do 1 pullup, do the one, then do 10 more negative pullups, then rest and repeat. You will almost certainly lose weight this month no matter what, so don't worry about your diet, except get lots of protein."

            "Hey,\n\nFirst of all, I'd like to know if you do any strength training? If not, that's first thing I recommend. More muscle usually equals more healthy body if done safely. If you don't like the idea of going to the gym, you can just as easily build muscle with basic bodyweight movements like pushup, pull ups and squats. More muscle also equals more calories burned, since muscle is metabolically active all the time. \n\nSecond thing, I recommend actually raising your calories. Now I know it sounds counterproductive, but I promise you will feel way better if you keep your calories around maintanance. The bad thing about deep calorie deficits is that your body learns to save energy by lowering its calorie needs. The symptoms of this are usually grogginess, lack of energy and motivation, bad sleep and extreme hunger. Now 850 calorie deficit is pretty freaking high in my opinion and I couldn't imagine how weak I would feel. This is why I recommend eating more. You can keep your activity levels as they are, you are an active individual and that's great! \n\nAlso, I want to point out that 1,7kg fat loss is nothing to be disappointed about. Progress is ALWAYS progress no matter how small it is. The slower you lose fat, the longer you actually keep it off. In my first year of fitness and dieting I made the most typical mistake of losing 10kg in only a few weeks. Of course it felt great to see progress so fast but let me tell you, that lifestyle was not sustainable, so I quickly gained it all back and some more. Maintaining my calories and doing strength training, as well as, some cardio on the side helped me stay fit and feel great! One more secret I learned... What actually matters in fitness is how you perform, look and feel about yourself. Chasing some arbitrary number usually doesn't lead to a path of lifelong fitness.\n\nWow that was a lot to keep in mind! I'll recap here so you can get the main point easily. \n\n\\-Do strength training (few times a week either in the gym or bodyweight training).\n\n\\-Raise your calories to maintanance (your metabolism and energy levels will thank you).\n\n\\-Remember to listen to yourself and measure more how you look, feel and perform. Numbers are deceiving.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo wrap it all up, please just be patient with yourself. Long term success comes from patience and trusting the process.

            "So you lost 1.47kg fat and .22kg lean tissue in 4 weeks. So about .42kg total per week, 85% of it fat.\n\n70-90% at .4kg total per week is my personal benchmark, so I would say you are in the ballpark for normal cutting, but not as good as you could be (although genetics also play a large role).\n\nSo first off, you aren't at a -850 calorie deficit, or you would have lost twice as much total weight - the math says you are at about a 400 calorie deficit. Likely this is for 4 reasons, first people eat more than they realize. Second, calorie counts on boxes undercount calories. Third, your metabolism has slowed since your first week.  Fourth, calorie expenditure guesses aren't very accurate.\n\nIf you want to improve your speed of weight loss, you need to cut more calories, if you want to increase the percentage of your weight loss that is fat, you need to lift more and eat more protein. If you aren't lifting at all, I would recommend 4 hours per week of intense lifting with rests. Lifting is pretty much always better than cardio for muscle retention. Try to eat 150g of protein a day.\n\nThat being said, I think you should be happy with your results unless you are contest prepping. If you go more extreme (and you can), it might become more miserable and less sustainable long term. So maybe you are losing weight half as fast, and have to do it twice as long, but you have way more energy than you would if you doubled the speed. If I were you, I'd do the increase of protein and lifting and see where that gets me, before I cut calories anymore. (Maybe i'd take them down a little, say 100/day, if I'm still not feeling lethargic or hungry all the time)",
            "Also, intermittent fasting is NOT ideal for your fat-to-muscle loss ratio. If you want to intermittent fast, then you should prepare 2 meals of 30-40g of protein powder for other parts of the day so you can maximize muscle protein synthesis. I don't think protein powder will ruin the intermittent fasting too badly, and it will help a lot with muscle retention.\n\nBasically 30g of protein triggers several hours of muscle protein synthesis. Taking in a little bit triggers nothing, and taking in more than 40g doesn't increase the amount of synthesis, so its optimal to have a dose of at least 30g several times per day. This (plus not getting enough total protein) is why intermittent fasters are more likely to have higher body fat percentages for their respective weights. Very hard to eat 150 of protein in a 4 hour window."

People have different strengths and weaknesses. Some people have a really good squat compared to their bench, some people the other way around. There's nothing wrong with hitting a 315 squat before a 225 bench. In fact, that's pretty common. \n\nEnjoy your strengths and shore up your weaknesses. Benching more is fine if you want to bench more, but that means you *put more resources into bench* (more time, more sets in the gym), not artificially stopping yourself from hitting certain squat weights."

            "So far this year as in, for the last 20 days?  How are you measuring progress, in terms of muscle growth?  \n\nYou don't necessarily have to increase weight each set. Some programs do that, others do straight. It's kind of up to you and your goals.  Personally I prefer straight sets on any given day.  \n\nJust make sure each set is relatively hard.  Aim for RPE 7-9 on each set. If you have more in the tank, do another hard set.  Aim to hit your maximum recoverable volume (MRV) on any given day. \n\nDepending on how you're measuring progress, it just takes time and consistency. I'm assuming you're measuring based on what your muscles look like as opposed to like a 1RM or something. Muscles take a long time to grow, so give it time and keep it up.",

            "Research progressive overload. This is basic knowledge that\u2019s at the foundation of any successful lifter. Choose a rep and set scheme tailored towards your goals. 3x8 is good for beginners-intermediate who want muscle and strength gains equally. Then use a weight that you would NOT be able to do an extra rep with on the LAST set. \n\nYou should be able to have just enough in the tank to finish 3x8 or whatever your rep/set scheme is.\n\nAfter this you eat enough protein, carbs, fats, and calories to recover, protein and calories being the most important.\n\nThen two days later you increase the weight by 5lbs, or 2.5kg. Same with all other lifts.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of variation for programming your workouts. And there are programs that allow you to workout every day, but the foundation of progressive overload remains the same.

            "Hey,\n\nI'll try to answer your questions. Here's a few tips that might help:\n\n* For your at home workouts I would recommend sticking to the basics. Try to focus on building muscle so keep your reps relatively low and intese. Somewhere around 8-11 reps to near failure will suffice. If you don't have any equipment (bands, dumbbells, kettlebells) do bodyweight execises. Just a basic squats, push ups and some rows will do. Don't worry if you can't do a proper push up yet, you'll get there. Start by doing push ups against an incline or some kind of object to make it easier. Rows can be a little tough at home but try using two chairs for example. If you have a park nearby with some bars, they will help significantly. \n   * If you do have equipment at home it makes everything a little bit easier. To train your chest, lay on a platform with enough support to hold you on it. Then just do simple dumbbell bench press. Squats can be replicated the same way by having the weight in your hands while performin. Rows become much easier with equipment. With kettlebells and dumbbells just bend over and start rowing by pulling with your elbows (not arms). If you have a band, attach it somewhere firm and just pull the band to your chest.\n* Diets can be changed to your own liking. I recommend eating natural foods, for example meat, eggs, dairy, fruits, berries, honey, maple syrup and butter. Don't be afraid of fat! It contains many vitamins that help your body perform and they are not found anywhere else. I also recommend not going too deep into a calorie deficit. It makes you perform worse, moody and slows down metabolism. Stay somewhere in your maintanance zone and focus on muscle building.\n* About the loose skin. There's literally no way you'll have loose skin if you lose weight at a healthy and normal pace. Unless you're losing 50lbs per week, you don't have to worry about it. Make small adjustments to your activity levels and diet to assure sustainable results.\n\n\\+ A little extra bonus tip I've found useful over the years. Don't get too caught up in numbers like your weight. Focus on how you feel, look and perform. They are tough to accurately measure, but they will for sure make your life easier. In my experience chasing numbers makes you do unsustainable life choices and once the numbers don't change you'll get discouraged.\n\nThat was a lot but I hope it helps you on your journey!

If you are looking to gain muscle, you have to use weights (if you decide to do Pilates, you can find ways to incorporate weight for gains. For example you can add ankle weights and dumbbells to your workout). If your goal is to gain muscle and lose fat you have to exercise with weights and incorporate cardio in your routine. I recommend you do at least 20 minutes of cardio per session for fat loss (any cyclic activity will work ex. Running, swimming, biking, etc).

In terms of weight training, you definitely want to include at least \"the big three\" of squats, deadlifts, and bench press. Personally, I like to also include the overhead press and bent-over rows, along with pull-ups and leg curls.\n\nAdditionally, you will need to identify your goals. For example, if this is preparation for a competition, you will want to make sure you at least occasionally include the lift in which you would compete. I don't compete and, therefore, don't include any competition-specific lifts but that's me.",

            "Any press exercise will do but the best one is pushups.  It sounds as if your shoulders are fairly unconditioned so go slow.  Pushups from the knees or even standing pushups against the wall.  Just crank out a few sets here and there.

You are starting out so it's not worth it to be delusional and think you can lift heavy weights.  The reason I say this is shoulder injuries can happen suddenly and they take weeks/months to heal.  And just the embarrassment of giving yourself a shoulder injury is enough reason to avoid that situation entirely.\n\nIf you are feeling weakness in the shoulders most likely there is a lack of bloodflow to both areas of the body.  You'll want to just get the blood flowing a few times per day.  Your body just won't direct as much bloodflow to a part of the body that is not being used.

Progressive overload is when you lift a little bit more weight then last time unless you reach failure before your final set.  With only a few pieces of equipment the best/only way to simulate it is with extra volume.  It's one of the main benefits of joining a gym because who has the space and money to afford an entire weight set.  Even then some people walk around the gym with half lb plates in their pockets.  With that they can simulate progressive overload on every set they do at the gym.\n\nIf you have optimized the other parts of your training you owe it to yourself to include progressive overload.

        "responses": [
            "\\--If i shifted from Terrible diet and no exercise to just a slightly bad diet and little exercise would i see results?\n\nYes, most definitely. The key would be to make those changes sustainable over a long period of time.  That's the key to wellness: maintaining a healthy lifestyle over a long period of time.\n\n\\--I don't want to say it will be \"EASY\" but considering how badly i treat my body it seems like a change to just treating my body in an \"average\" way would result in help?\n\nIt's rarely complicated but also rarely easy.  You fell in to this poor diet out of convenience and comfort.  So why are you seeking those things?  A common answer is stress eating or habitual eating.  But the answer to your situation will be deeply personal.  I went through something similar; I was almost 300, made a series of lifestyle changes, lost nearly 80 lbs in a short amount of time.  At the end of it I was a little bit more healthy but I was overloaded with mental health issues.  It was as if my layers of fat were covering up my mental health issues and once the fat was gone they went wild.  Also I took away my crutch for dealing with those issues which was eating junk food.  So it was a tough road but things were much easier when I found a healthy(ier) option for each of my vices.  This part of the journey is deeply personal so me telling you exactly what to do and with what outcomes just doesn't make sense.  You wrote a lot so it seems like you have been thinking about this for a while.  You probably have a few ideas already.\n\n\\--is this a bad way of thinking about it?\n\nNot bad but not complete.  To get the results you want you need planning and action.  Planning is more concrete such as diet plans, workout plans, meal plans, etc.  Action is the most important part.  Some things you won't know how effective they are until you give it a go.  All the social media, vlogs, self help books, etc. are great sources of inspiration and it's common to get stuck in a rut constantly planning things in your head without trying it out.  Distraction and temptation is just a few touchscreen clicks away.  To get started you don't have to be great but to be great you must get started.\n\n\\--Like I I continued to eat like shit 3 days a week but made lean protein and veggies for 4 days, that would be an improvement and would lead to weight loss right?\n\nIt would be a step in the right direction but, personally speaking, it would be too easy to backslide in to the convenient habits of eating like shit.  \"Lifestyle change\" has been the popular term and how it makes sense to me is that every breath you take for the rest of my life I'll be following a healthy lifestyle.  The idea of following a healthy lifestyle part time is a bit practical but in practice it would be a pain in the butt.  It's better to go at this 24/7 and continually optimize things and habits to keep things exciting.  It will be necessary just to keep building muscle as you get more fit but also to stop yourself from getting bored.  If this is important and you want to stick to it everyday it should be fun.  Don't want to end up quitting on a workout because that is just more opportunity to backslide in to poor lifestyle choices.\n\n\\--should i be doing one at a time? or does mixing it up work too?\n\nMixing it up is the best way.  This is the rest of your life we are talking about.  So I imagine you'll end up doing both eventually.  Some people join a crossfit gym where people do group exercises and everyone cheers eachother on and high fives all around once the WOD (workout of the day) is complete.  I work out at home mostly.   The key is finding something that works for you.\n\n\\--I really truly fear for my health and my life, I have a kid on the way, and the idea of being 350 or 400 eventually or something if I dont make a change devastates me.\n\nYou have the right idea.  Being healthy is important and that's a lesson you would like to show to your child.  How you handle this challenge will be noticed by your entire family.  So you have an opportunity to set a good example of how great life can be when you are healthy and fit.  I find sports are so much more fun when I don't have to struggle through each game.  Also, carrying extra weight makes you vulnerable to dozens of different diseases and maladies.  Ever see an overweight old person (75+)?  Probably not because overweight people don't live long lives. Congratulations on having a kid on the way."

If you wanted to fit in a goblet squat or a weighted lunge in between you'd be very sadistic.\n\nIf you wanted to do something more practical regular burpees burn around 15 cals per minute.

Low rep is greeat for building strength, having fun while working out, building muscle mass, and increasing endurance.  High rep training is good for building endurance, and putting more volume in to your muscle, burning extra calories.  Either method is fine it's just best that you stick with it for a long period of time.  Just choose the one that is more sustainable for you.  If you don't have access to heavy weights then high rep training may be the only option.  Most lifters do a mix of both;  Personally, I make sure I mix in more volume training about 4 months when I know anyone will see me with my shirt off.  Also, if i'm on a cutting diet i'll mix in more volume training.  Other than that it's low rep for me.  It's much more fun to clang and bang the big weights at the gym.",

            "Yes but it feels less intense as you get healthier.  A good workout does a lot of damage to your muscle fibers and if you have yet to learn good form you could have some damage or stress on your joints/tendons.  If it's been less than a day since the workout test things out if something feels like it has lost strength or just can't work mechanically then get checked out by a doc or physiotherapist.  But if you can still move normally but with a lot of stiffness and discomfort that is just your body healing.  If you want quick relief a quick warmup involving the same muscles gives them a chance to loosen up.  Foam rolling and magnesium glycinate are straight up magical for your recovery.  Leafy greens in your diet help the most though.  Basically you want lots of micros and minerals to help aid the body.   Spinach is the MVP for this since it has protein.\n\nWhen it finishes this process it is slightly stronger because your subconscious knows you just went through something stressful and your athletic performance was stressed to the max.  It doesn't know either way but just in case your athletics kept/saved you from danger when it healed it made you just a little bit stronger.  So that is where you actually get stronger or more athletic.\n\nIt's like a 1-2 combo workout then recovery. So workouts are important but equally important is your recovery.  Stay hydrated, eat healthy, don't miss any sleep, take a nap if you can, etc.  Do all of that and it gets better.  It's not easy because of the stiffness and discomfort but it gets better.  From sedentary slug status to conditioned it takes me 6 months.  But it's different for everyone.  I'm 40 so if I could go back to 17 it would take less than 6 days. But when I'm conditioned I feel fantastic mostly.  But I kind of get excited because it doesn't happen very often.  Enjoy your newbie gains they are the best gains you'll ever have.",

            "I get terrible DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness), so I hear you.\n\nThe key is to ease into your workout, because after a couple weeks (say 4 sessions on a particular muscle), you won't get sore anymore unless you change your workout or if you miss a couple days. So do the amount of working out that will make you a tiny bit sore, but not terribly sore. When I'm starting out after hiatus, I do 75% of the old weight and 75% of the old volume the first time I work a muscle group and then up it from there.\n\nThe reason its better to ease in, is that if you prevent soreness, you will end up doing more volume with more weight in the end because you won't have to skip workouts or fail in workouts because you are sore.\n\nThat being said, I would do a regular workout if the muscles that are sore aren't the ones I'm working out. If I AM working out the sore muscles, I again reduce the workout significantly in volume and weight.",

So what happened to me could be happening to you.  Since I was missing out on sleep I just wasn't letting my body recover.  Each workout was simply beating my body up and the healing just wasn't happening.  I had a few other issues that was contributing to this.\n\nI think you should try what worked for me.  I did two things I started supplementing my sleep and I backed off on my training intensity.  Chamomille tea, GABA, Magneium Glycinate sleep powders, Tryptophan, etc.  Surprisingly, eating a large bowl of oatmeal before bed helps you sleep.  Apparently cooked oatmeal has Tryptophan in it so 0ats has nutrients for your mind and body.  Oats are awesome.  Backing off at the gym was the other big part.  I changed my mind set from putting up big numbers to building muscle.  Slow reps made this easy since they pretty much force you to learn good form.  They seem to increase the difficulty by a significant amount.  Try a 10 second pushup where it's 4 seconds down and 6 seconds up.  It will feel a few times more difficult.  Also, I defined failure to be whenever my exercise form breaks down for any reason.  The most common reason was fatigue.  I was just in the middle of a tough workout.  After a half year I actually built muscle so my numbers in the gym passed where I was at months ago.\n\nThere's a sleep clinic in my area.  I'm interested to check it out and get tested.  Good quality sleep lets your brain release potent hormones like HGH.  If your sleep is of poor quality you're probably missing out."

If you are looking leaner you are probably losing fat and adding muscle. When you get old enough to work you can invest in home exercise equipment such as adjustable dumbbells or my favorite running shoes. I bought several pieces of exercise equipment on sale so i have barbell, dumbbells and workout bench. I found that first i got strong and later i put on muscle. adjust your bodyweight exercises to increase intensity. For example knee pushups use 40% bodyweight full pushups use 60% feet elevated pushups use 80%. Check you parents pantry for your weights. Cans of soup. bags of rice, 5 pound bags of flour. then there is bricks jugs of water. during the pandemic people made their own exercise equipment. If you drink milk save two milk jugs. A gallon of water weighs 8 pounds. one in each hand gives 16 pounds. Hang 4 on a broomstick and you got 32 pounds. Be creative!!",

It will do you so many favours in the future. Good form will allow you to push even more weight eventually.\n\nAs for your dieting issue I would suggest getting your hands on some oatmeal or oats.  Protein powder would be better but it's more expensive where oats are easy to shop for with deals that are under $3/kg.  It has protein, carbs, fiber, and some minerals like manganese.  It's easy to store and doesn't need refrigeration so you could keep a tub of it in your bedroom and just drag it down to the kitchen for breakfast or lunch.  Your family might be offended by that.  I would suggest to make a bowl of oatmeal and consume it in your room.  This could be less offensive or confrontational with your family.  If anyone asks why you are eating oatmeal on your own just say you''re trying to get bigger.  The taste and texture is awful but it's easy to tweak the toppings.  A spoonful of cinnamon has been my favourite lately.  Low calorie syrup would be another easy and inexpensive.   A scoop of protein powder is popular but it's just not for me.\n\nThese things are low cost but are not zero cost.  Take a look at your income and spending.  Making sacrifices for oatmeal will be worth it.",

Protein becomes more important the older you get.   \n\n\nI would just try to eat more if I was you so that you are gaining no more than 1lb per week. If you do that, everything will work out. If you optimized perfectly maybe you put on 100% muscle and 0% fat, but if you don't optimize, then youll probably still put on like 90% muscle and 10% fat since you are at the beginner gains stage.   \n\n\nThe really important thing is to optimize how much volume of excercise you are doing. Its hard to do this with just body weight, so I would say that there is no amount of working out that would be \"too much\" for you given that you are the age you are, and on a calorie surplus.",

Beginner gains, let you gain weight, while also losing fat, which is super hard for older, more trained individuals. If you ate right you could probably lose fat and gain 12+ lbs of muscle in a year. You won't be able to do that later in your life and lifting career.  \n\n\nProtein powder is a cheap way to get protein if you buy in bulk. There are lots of youtube videos about the cheapest foods in $/gram of protein. Since you are young and a beginner, you might be able to eat high calorie foods that aren't health foods (like pasta), for your calories and not have any issues. Its about getting the right number of calories and enough protein. The reason processed foods are bad is that you end up overeating, and its bad for long term health, but you don't have the overeating issues, so some is probably ok."

Focus on jump height or squat weight, anything that can have a 4 week improvement goal that isn't your weight. The scale lies but performance doesn't. Don't push yourself 100% of the time. You risk overtraining and burnout which means depression. Set 3 - 6 week goals and start small.\n\nMost people bulk before cutting for muscle gains so you're already halfway there. The added strength will make burning fat much easier. Plus if your appetite is already up then you're going to want to work with that, not against it.\n\nI'd go for a mix of strength training and body building. See what your body likes most, do that for 6 - 12 months then mix in some cardio gradually. Try to make friends who are at experienced and beginner fitness levels.

The people that end up quitting have shitty goals such as: \"Umm, uhh I dunno I want to lose some weight\".  Try to be more specific than that.  Do what you got to do.  You're 17 so maybe you havent had a chance to do this but you are growing up fast.  Getting more specific about what you want out of life is a very important skill for a young man.\n\nTiming trumps all.  If you live in a place where the winters are difficult well its a perfect time to bulk.  You are bundling up anyways so people are less likely to notice.   Unless you bulk like an idiot and just turn yourself into a fat slob.  The sequence for me typically goes bulk in the winter, cut in the spring/summer, and just maintain in the fall.  Sounds kind of boring but it's typically how it works out.",
            "Yeah, per below, I think you can't do either until you've worked out for 6 months since you get beginner gains during that time period and it almost makes bulking and cutting unneeded.   \n\n\nAfter that, it depends on the body fat level that you think you can maintain. A common mistake is to bulk and then never have the willpower to actually cut.",
            "Well I\u2019ve been dieting since may and I\u2019ve been working out since the beginning of September and overall I\u2019ve lost 50 lbs just as something I had neglected to mention.",
            "If possible I could edit the post to include a picture of myself so maybe it\u2019d be easier to gauge",
            "Nice job! Sounds like you\u2019ve had a lot of progress. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve plateaued at all so the choice to bulk or cut won\u2019t help. New lifter gains far eclipse the gains from bulking or cutting. You\u2019re doing fine but get more clear on your goals. Cant have a plan or a clue until you get some decent goals.",
            "Not necessary.  Have you experienced a few plateaus in the last year at least?",
            "Where do I start when coming up with these goals because at the moment I want to get down to a good weight but I\u2019m not even sure what a good weight would be",
            "A couple weeks ago but I\u2019ve started losing weight again",
            "There are so many ways to do this.  You want to be inspired by others but at the same time the goals should be coming from your own mind.  Those workouts that are so tough they make you want to quit but the goal means something important to you.  Something that will keep you in the game and keep you coming back for more again and again.  The shitty goal of: \"Umm, i dunno I just want to lose some weight\".  Is easier to procrastinate than say a specific goal like: \"I will run a half marathon in under 3 hours this year\".  A big difference is that a good goal is specific in two ways you can pass or fail and there is a time limit.  \n\nWhat works for me is I focus and I write a list of five people I find impressive and why.  Whatever snags my interest.  Is it John Cena and his gigantic delts? Is it Albert Einstein for his scientific creativity?  Maybe it's Keanu Reeves and his random acts kindness? What is impressive to \\*\\*\\*\\*YOU\\*\\*\\*\\*.  Not what you think someone else would want you think is impressive.  This part is hard because you are 17.  Maybe there is a few things you are thinking of that you havent found out about yet.  You have lots of time to learn and this stuff is super neat anyways.  But you are almost a man and so it can only help you to start getting specific about your life.  Knowing what you want your life to be about is a great thing to learn about at a young age.  \n\nThen, write a second list of tasks that will help you become more like those people.  From this list develop a plan to work on these things every day.  I do something like this every morning and it's impressive how it develops your life.  It's all fueled by your unique inspiration.\n\nLife is complex and so me telling you exactly what you should do, how, and with what results is almost meaningless.  You can find \"coaches\" online but they are pretty expensive and honestly this stuff is not complicated and it's really neat.  It's better that you become captain of your ship then waiting for someone to provide you with all the answers.",
            "That's great.  So when you have 3 to 5 of those in less than a year then i would suggest it.  Newbie gains are the best gains.  Do everything you can to enjoy those.  A bulk or cutting diet would be a waste of time and could have a negative affect in your newbie gains.  Also, you have a humungous advantage right now.  You are a 17 year old male and your brain is developing to be a testosterone factory.  It's like being on steroids for free.  Everything in your biology is tuned toward reaching your goals.  Man I miss those days.  \n\nWhen I run in to a plateau it's usually diet related.  I make a change in my diet and the plateau ends and i move on to the next thing.  Recognizing training plateaus, dealing with them, and then bouncing back becomes very repetitious.  Many people quit or just get frustrated.  So dealing with these plateaus becomes important to stay on the grind.  That's how you make sure you win by staying on the grind over a long period of time."

        "responses": [
            "TLDR: Lift hard 5x per week. Don't eat processed foods. Eat 1g protein per lb. Track your weight.\n\nI'm going to give you my playbook for this (lightly modified) since I know the scientific literature pretty well and have put it into practice in my own life. I'll do the science, then the big practical implications.\n\nScience:\n\nThe big things you can effect that change your appearance are body fat percentage and muscle size. There is no such thing as toning, and no such thing as losing body fat in a specific area because you worked it out.\n\nIf you optimally lose fat, you will lose about 70-90% fat and 10%-30% muscle, and vice versa when gaining muscle (10-30% will be fat). However new lifters get a 6-12 month grace period where they can lose fat AND increase muscle. Take advantage. This also means that when gaining weight, its difficult to reduce body fat percentage if you are below 30%, so you have to do that during a calorie deficit.\n\nThe only macro that really matters for body fat percentage and muscle size is protein. You need to eat enough fat to keep your hormone health in check. Some people find that carb restriction results in them eating less calories, which results in calorie deficit, but really its just about restricting SOMETHING (calories, carbs, fats, certain foods). Reducing carbs will lead to a loss of water weight, which will come back when you stop. Super low carb diets can cause 5lbs of water weight loss, so be aware.\n\nVaping won't effect your physique very much, but its bad for your health. If you need nicotine, the gum is far less addictive and doesn't seem to have negative health effects unless you have super high blood pressure.\n\nBig Things in Order of importance & why\n\n1. \\*\\*Lift 5 days a week or as much as possible. Don't half ass the gym, intensity matters. Progressive overload matters. -\\*\\*The best thing you can do is to ensure that when you overeat, the calories become muscle, and when you undereat, the deficit is taken from fat rather than from muscle. That means staying active so your body is always repairing muscle.\n2. **Don't do anything that isn't sustainable.** People like to think if they lose 100 lbs it will be easy to keep off. It doesn't work that way. If you add 2 workouts per week and lose 10lbs, then go back to less workouts, you will put back on the weight. Or if you stop watching what you eat, you will put back on the weight. Don't bother with changes that you can't make permanent, unless its for an event like a wedding. NOTE that this means that you should be doing the number of gym visits per week that you can maintain for the rest of your life. If you can't do 5, then do 3.\n3. **Eat 1g of protein per lb.** You probably could get away with less, but most people eat less than they aim to eat. Protein helps muscle growth and reduces muscle loss during calorie surplus/deficit.\n4. **Cut out all the processed foods, esp added sugar.** If you eat processed foods you will eat more than you intend to eat and feel less satiated. There are people with crazy will power that can be at a calorie deficit AND eat bad food, but why put yourself through that.\n5. **Hard cardio is way overrated for physique, but its still healthy for you.** All cardio does for body fat percentage is provide a little extra calorie burn and a little muscle repair, but you end up eating more so it doesn't provide a lot of benefit. Its good for long term health though.\n6. **Get the habit of tracking something daily about your physique.** The easiest thing to track is your weight each day. If you think its sustainable you can track macros or calories. You can also track waist size, which is an extremely good measure of body fat percentage. Eating the right amount becomes far easier if you have this daily reminder. A one lb bodyweight loss is generally 3600 calories, but people tend to underestimate how much they are eating.\n7. **Don't lose or gain more than 1lb a week unless you are new to lifting or very heavy.** Once you pass 1lb a week, you tend to be far less efficient in terms of losing too much muscle or gaining too much fat as a percentage. Additionally, those habits aren't sustainable (per #2). If you are new to lifting you can get away with more. If you have 30%+ body fat you can get away with more, but make it sustainable (if it takes all your willpower, its not sustainable).  1lb per week means about 500 calories less than maintenance calories since a lb is 3600 calories.\n8. **Sleep is very important, you will need to sleep more given how much you are lifting.** Bad sleep hurts hormone health and more importantly causes you to overeat.\n9. **Don't hurt yourself.** If you don't know what you are doing in the gym, get a friend or trainer to show you. Its worth the money for one session. If you are hurt for a month it totally spikes your progress because you don't just lose progress, you also regress.\n10. **People generally have a body fat percentage set point.** Lets say your set point is 20% body fat. Depending on your daily habits, perhaps this person can walk around at anywhere from 10%-40% body fat percentage permanently. Adding habits that get them from 20% to15% is far easier than adding habits that get them from 15% to 10%. If they drop below 10% their body will start freaking out and their hormones will get out of wack and they will put on weight. This has implications for sustainability. Do NOT do something unsustainable in order to get way beneath your set point since it will not work. Additionally, body fat percentage set points ONLY go up. If you maintain high body fat for a long time, your set point will increase, but maintaining low body fat will not bring your set point down (just prevent further increase).\n11. **Meal Prep is a great way to control calories.** You cook meals for the week. You know how much is in each meal. They are convenient and healthy, if a little boring.\n\n**Smaller optimizations that barely matter:**\n\n* Its good to eat after the gym for muscle gain purposes\n* Creatine works pretty well as a supplement (hair loss can be a rare side effect for people who have that issue). It ads water weight while you are taking it, but the water makes your muscles look bigger.\n* Pre-workout seems to work pretty well too, but know whats in your pre-workout as there can be side effects.\n* Big lifts are generally more time efficient for body fat percentage purposes, but you can get the same effect from doing a circuit.\n* Higher testosterone (within natural levels) seems to help slightly with natural body fat percentage, but not muscle gain. Sunlight, sleep, high activity levels improve this.\n* You want to do 10-15 hard sets per week per muscle group if you aren't a bodybuilder. You want to do at least 6 reps per set if your goal is physique and not strength."

But I have a few guesses listed from least likely to most likely.\n\n1) It could be testosterone related.\n\n2) Hydration in the past 24hrs.\n\n3) What you ate AFTER your last intense exercise. Your muscles store energy locally that only gets released during peak performance. These energy stores get replenished with whatever is put in your system within 30-60min after your workout.\n\n4) What form you're using. You could be accidentally rolling your hips back on these high performance days and pacing your breath better instead of trying to white knuckle the workout. Running is an efficiency puzzle and the lower heart rate points in this direction. I would start recording every single run you do.

There is no shame in being cautious at this point it is very smart. The opportunity for injury is much higher at this point.  After a year your strength will be impressive.  Bodyweight squats, standing pushups while leaning against the wall, bodyweight lunges, crunches, planks. Design each workout with sets and rest.  \n\nCardio will be important.  A simple structured walking program will be the best for that.  You must be itching to get out of the house and see more of your area.  This will be your opportunity to do it in an organized manner.  Most people pick there favourite coffee shop in their city and resolve to walk to and from it every morning.  \n\nAll of this effort can be sabotaged by a crappy diet. After a long hospital stay your body can become weak but so can your digestion.  The older you are the more likely this is an issue.  Design a diet that includes easy to digest food that is nutrient dense. White rice, oatmeal, white meat, veggies, etc.  The classic body building meal is chicken, rice, and brocolli because it is nutrient dense, easy to digest, inexpensive, and easy to prepare.  You can eat large amounts of it and still have enough energy to crush your daily workout and live your life afterwards.  Best of luck to you.",

Personally, I found it a great way to kick start a new diet.\n\nThe more difficult part is controlling diet.  And that is something that has no end.  The rest of life has to be disciplined.  I had to teach myself new skills like food prep, cleaning, shopping, counting calories, hydration planning, etc.  Counting calories seemed to be the most technical and rewarding.  Most people use a handy little phone app to do it like Myfitnesspal.  But counting calories seemed to be the fundamental skill that was missing.  From that point I no longer had to guess if I was over or under eating.  Most delicious foods seem to have great taste and texture but little to no nutrients.  From that point my food prep and shopping habits changed for the better.  Going with nutritious meals just seems like a much better value for money.  Best deal I found so far was $1 for two servings of frozen spinach.\n\nOnce you count calories for long enough you start seeing food portions differently.  I have hundreds of those little plastic scoops that come with each bag of protein powder.  They make food prep and counting calories much more simple.

The following are some things I'd like to accomplish:\n\n- Improve endurance.  Currently just rotating my arms a few times or doing about 20 squats is enough to tire me out.\n\n- Do pushups.  I've tried wall pushups before, but didn't know how many sets and repititions to start with so I ended up really sore and that lead to me getting discouraged and giving up.\n\n- For strength, I'd like to be able to carry around 200 lbs without too much difficulty.  I'd also like to be able to twist open jars, because it's embarrassing how many times I needed help with this.\n\n- Flexibility.  I want to be able to touch my toes again.  I've noticed my joints, especially the knees and shoulders, have stiffened and sometimes making a snapping or cracking sound.\n\nMy diet is fairly simple.  I eat a bowl of cereal with milk in the morning, for lunch I have a sandwich and some tea, and for dinner it's usually rice or pasta, with some proteins and vegetables.  With the way I've been feeling I have been finding it a little hard to want to eat, but I'm still making myself eat regularly, just in smaller portions so I can keep it down.\n\nSleep tends to vary.  I sometimes have insomnia.  On my days off from work, I sometimes have a hard time finding the motivation to get out of bed, so I might stay in bed for an hour longer.\n\nI've spoken with my family doctor, but haven't seen a therapist.  It usually starts with my anxiety bringing out some negative thoughts, and then those thoughts lead to a period of depression that can last for a long time.  My doctor prescribed me some valium in the past for when the anxiety gets really bad, but, I don't like taking it.  It's been about two months now, but after talking with some people, I'm gradually starting to feel better, so I think I'm almost  back to \"normal\" or as normal as I get.",
            "So, a few things.\nOne, if you don't like taking Valium, take it to an actual therapist and see what is best. If normal is still depressed and anxious, then try looking up Open Path. Licensed therapists and counselors with negotiable rates\n\nSo, try to get 8 hours of good sleep. I sometimes manage 6 hours, but I will always be sluggish.\n\nYou get three meals a day. I'd suggest protein with every meal (so milk or yogurt in morning, chicken sando, and protein at night) don't get hung up on protein supplements, but if you feel that a meal might be lacking, basic protein powder is a great way to go.\n\nYour goals\n\nEnergy. So all the things I mentioned above, especially mental health, will affect your energy. If your just trying to increase your endurance, you can look at running splits (walk one minute, run one minute)  or doing cardio like jumping jacks, jump rope, ect. Those cardio workouts can help wake you up and get you energized.\n\nPush ups. There are a few ways to go at this. Make sure to research and see if you are doing you form properly. Stating out, I would do 10 pushups 3 time (3 sets of 10) or failure. You can do wall, assisted, of knees.\n\n200lbs is a lot. I got big ol arms and legs and struggle with that, outside of maybe a fire man carry. How do you want to lift things? I would stick with 3 set of 10 of anything you are wanting to lift  if you can do more that 10 on that first set, increase weight. If you can't get past 5, lower weight.\n\nDon't worry too much about those noises in your joints unless they become painful. Stretching is the only thing there. You might benefit from yoga. I follow \"Yoga with Adrienne\" on YouTube. Find a video or series she does and stick with it for a month.\n\n\nThis will all take time. You may want to talk to your doctor and maybe a CrossFit trainer, since that would help cover all your bases.",

Is it three sets throughout the course of a day or with only a small break in between?\n\nThe 200lbs goal is probably overly ambitious.  I selected the number as a rough guess of how much I might need to carry in an emergency.  I was thinking about what I would do if there was a disaster and I realized chances are I wouldn't be able to help carry anyone injured or even supplies.",
            "You take a break. 1 to 2 minutes, or more. The most important is to do it, the lower the rest time the more train your endurance. But at least a minute.\n For emergency situations, that's a whole other reddit thread.",

Adding muscle mass will do nothing to increase the elasticity of the muscle-tendon unit. I saw Frank Shorter the Olympic marathon winner years ago.

For cross country you want skinny legs. Trying to go from underweight to massive is really not possible. We all have our genetic potential. If you are good at cross country focus on distance work. for example, Olympian Usain Bolt is fastest man alive for 100 and 200 meters. He tried to run 400 meters and he couldn't finish.

            "I don't know exactly what to tell you, because the story doesn't quite add up for me. If you are in your early 20s and took 1 year off from being a high performance athlete, you really shouldn't have lost as much as you are indicating. Like you should be running faster than 20 minute mile pace and you shouldn't be getting winded during lifting (which isn't cardio intensive).   \n\n\nMy general advice that isn't dependent on the above is that you need to make sure that you eat at a slight surplus of calories for maximum recovery (Don't try to lose weight at the same time). You should start lifting right away. You should do as much as you can of both cardio and lifting without making yourself very sore (DOMS). Soreness will cut the volume of intensity of your workouts and that loss is not worth it for a single extra hard workout. Finally, if you do any new lifts, where you don't have the form and neuromuscular connection from prior, you should start very slow to avoid injury. You should also sleep more each day to aid recovery (up to an hour). I'd think 3 days of cardio and 3 days of lifting (60-90 minutes each day) is about the max I would recommend.  \n\n\nFinally, when getting back in shape, you will hit a wall after a 2-4 weeks where your body just says \"I'm too tired to do anything.\" I highly recommend taking a rest day, and perhaps some low intensity days in addition.",

You might also just find that reducing volume for a bit lets you break through.",
            "i don't think you need more sets I think you need more rest. If you can't do much after the third set then stop. you don't need more than 3 good sets. Alternately you could drop the weight and do good quality five sets. If you are struggling to finish and have to do bodyweight squats because of fatigue, you aren't getting much from it. Sometimes you have to listen to the body and back off. I will do a rest month sometimes where i drop the weight and just do one or two sets with light weight. Then go back to heavier training the next month. I also will do a high frequency month with moderate weights but i train everyday with no rest. It is a killer workout and sometimes i have to drop the weights on the bar to finish the month but the muscles just explode. I did a month of squats once and this month I am doing daily cardio for a change. Definitely my muscles are confused."

Let\u2019s leave out any medical reasons because that is a cause for loss of appetite along with emotional or psychological and physical causes. Injuries, break up, depression, medication. it can all cause a loss of appetite.\n\nI work nights as well. 11pm to 8am and 11pm to 11am and I work out before work at well. Since your diet has changed from ultra processed and fast food to a clean whole foods diet. Your body will adapt to that diet but it will take time. You\u2019ll feel fuller longer. Food timing matters in a sense if you wait to long after your done training you may not have much of an appetite. And if you do the food may fill you up quicker.\n\nIf you take your vitamins at night that may delay your appetite. If you trying to gain weight then you\u2019ll need to eat more but if your eating clean food you\u2019ll get full fast thus making bulking more harder but not impossible. \n\nJust as you train your muscles you have to train your stomach to eat to allow it to adapt and grow. If you are not sleeping well that will decrease your appetite as well. So stay hydrated. Sleep 7-9 hours. Lift intense but don\u2019t hurt yourself. Eat clean and healthy with lots of fibers. \n\nFollow a scheduled routine when it comes to eating I\u2019ll eat from 1am to 4am then again when I get home at 8am but I\u2019m bulking and they are large meals\n\nIf your job is not engaging or active during the night you may not feel the need to eat as well. Some people will eat out of boredom some won\u2019t eat because they aren\u2019t active it\u2019s like night time most people don\u2019t eat in the middle of the night so we are \u201cforcing\u201d ourselves to stay up and eat. \n\nBut when it comes to diet and training we have to force ourselves to commit.

I would try to encourage her to be as healthy as she can be for her health and for the health of our family.  If she becomes defensive and reacts to my efforts negatively I would just leave it alone.  I would then feel more inspired to lead by example to show her how beneficial it can be to live a fit lifestyle.  It is not very complicated but it takes a lot of discipline.  There are so many short term and long term benefits to it obviously.  Hopefully, she would take notice and join in on her own accord.\n\nFor me and many people, the barrier to pursue a fit lifestyle is in your head.  Sometime in the past a belief about ourselves was learned that is self limiting.  Beliefs such as being unfit as part of your social identity, giving up on endeavours that turn out to be difficult, prioritizing the needs of others over your own, etc.  I like to call all of that negative programming that unfortunately is very common for young people.  But, all of those things are just stories that we tell ourselves.  They are not final.  Just like you learned that story it is possible to unlearn it.  It is much easier to do this at a young age.  This is why it is so important how adults interact with children at school and at home.  Personally, I hit rock bottom and fortunately I bounced instead of going splat.  With that momentum I got hooked on consuming motivational media such as podcasts and books.  Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins and Atomic Habits by James Clear were the most influential.  Those books taught me that whatever I end up doing in life that is what I am.  That attitude helped me build a better life in many ways.",

I'd like some advice on the starting amount of weight for a few dumbbell exercises\n\nHi! :) I'm a fitness beginner and I'm trying to wrap my head around working out with dumbbells. If I were only doing one exercise with dumbbells, I'd just start at a comfortable level and slowly increase over various workouts.

This is partially why \"meal prep\" is so common and popular.  You prepare 3 days worth of food and that is all that you eat.  With this you could have careful control of the nutrients that your body ingests.  Also having healthy, high fiber, and nutrient dense snacks on hand is very helpful.  I make sure I always have at least 2 kg of quick oats on hand.  So when I have a craving I can quickly take care of it by having a quick bowl of oatmeal and then continue on with my day.

            "**Background**: People who lift a lot aren't able to put on more than .5kg of muscle per week, so if they are gaining more than that per week in weight, then they are likely making up the difference in muscle. You are a little bit except from this rule of thumb, since when people first start lifting (also people in puberty), can put on more than .5kg a week of muscle, however, you should still be aware that the faster you put on weight, the higher percentage of that will be fat (as opposed to muscle). Typically, if you are a trained lifter and you gain .5kg, about 20% of that will be fat, so if you are less than 20% body fat, then as you bulk up, your bodyfat % will rise even if you are doing everything correctly - thus a larger stomach temporarily.  \n\n\nThats why people bulk and then cut. When you cut .5kg a week, about 80% of that will be fat if you are doing it correctly, which causes a very large decrease in body fat percentage.  \n\n\n**The Problem:** So, it sounds like you are gaining a higher percentage of fat than you ideally should or you wouldn't have a larger belly. A really good way to measure this is by measuring your waist. If your waist is getting larger, then you are going up in body fat percentage.  \n\n\n**Advice:** First off, you need to do two things to maximize the percentage of weight gain that comes in as muscle (as opposed to fat). First is that you need to eat at least as many grams of protein as your weight in kg times 2. So you should be eating 120+, while avoiding junk food and processed food. If you aren't eating enough protein, this could be your issue.\n\nSecond, you need to be lifting with a really high intensity to maximize how much is muscle vs fat. I think doing about 100 sets (almost to failure) per week  is probably a good bar. The almost to failure part is important, because quality is super important. If you aren't doing compound lifts like deadlifts, squats, bench, rows etc, then you probably need more than 100 sets. If you aren't doing this, then this could be your issue.\n\nThird, you are gaining more weight than an experienced lifter can put on per week in muscle. Its possible that you are able to put on that much muscle as a new-ish lifter, but only if you are doing #1 and #2 above. If you ARE doing those two above things, and you still find your waist expanding or your belly getting fatter, then you should reduce your weight gain to something more like 4kg per month and if you still have issues, then 2kg per month (which is the typical for experienced lifters). Personally, I might even start with 2kg and then work my way up instead of starting at 6kg and working my way down. At some point you will need to cut weight if you want to bring back down your body fat percentage, but cutting is extremely difficult and painful, so most lifters try really hard not to put on too much fat during bulking.",

I am far fresher in the final games, if I cool my hands in between games. With workouts, I find that I am more likely to \"get through\" the entire 90 minute workout if I use it (I stop after 45-60 minutes more often then I like too). I suspect I get less DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) and that I perform better on my final sets under these conditions, but its not as obvious to me as the basketball results.  \n\n\nIts worth pointing out that I am weird in that I don't sweat very much - I'll come out of 2 hours of hot basketball with zero sweat stains. I was a pretty competitive athlete until 16 and my coach used to yell and yell at me for not drinking enough water, even though I would drink 1-1.5 gallons per day. Due to this, overheating was always a problem for me, and I'd underperform in hot weather situations, so its possible the cooled hands thing helps me more than it would help other people.",

My guess is that you are eating closer to 2500 calories a day without realizing it - although this isn't that important, which I will get to at the end. Second, the calorie estimates that machines and wearables give you are wrong in two ways... first, they often include the calories you would burn just by sitting there during that time period so maybe an extra 100 per hour. Additionally they overestimate exercise calories according to studies of this. \n\nHeres what you do... track your weight every morning before food/after bathroom, and all your calories. Eat the same thing everyday for a while to make things easier to track, and get a food scale so you can weigh the food. Also try to weigh things raw instead of cooked for more accurate estimates... At the end of the 9 days, average the first 3 days and the last 3 days and see how much weight you've lost. Then average your calories per day.  \n\n\nLets say that you lost 0 lbs and ate an average of 2000 calories per day. You need to lose 1 lb per week, so this means dropping 500 calories per day, so start aiming for 200-500=1500 calories. Now its possible your 2000 calorie estimate was wrong, because most people tend to forget to track some snacks, and a lot of calorie estimates are a little biased, but the important thing is that when you aim for 1500, you will also have biased estimates, so you will still lose a pound a week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn another example, lets say that you lost .4 lbs and you were eating 1800 calories. .4lbs\\*3600 calories in a lb = 1440 calories in the week, or 1440/7 = roughly 200 calories per day. So in this example, your maintenance calories were 1800+200=2000, and to lose a pound a week you need to drop once again to 1500.",

This is more of an advanced technique.  \n\n\nI'm not sure from your description (esp about max weight) exactly what you are doing, but this is what I think you should be doing as a beginner:  \n\n\nWrite down all your weights. So say you have 155 for bench. You get the gym, you do a set of 8-10 of 115 for warmup. You rest long enough that your heart rate isn't racing and that you can get through your next set. You do your second set at 155. Then you do your third set at 155 and your 4th set at 155. \n\nIf you get through all your reps without failing, then you add 5 to 155 and write down 160 for next time. If you don't finish all reps on all sets, then you leave it at 155.\n\nDrop sets are used when you've had a couple weeks in a row where you haven't gotten through all your reps at 155. So for example you are only ever getting 4 reps on your third set. At that point, you add a drop set where you bring the weight down to a level where you can do additional reps.\n\nIf this sounds like what you are doing, then you are doing it right.",

I know you're supposed to consume enough protein, but that's about it. I think my fat% is around 17% right now. I want to try and gain as much muscle as optimally possible, but all im doing right now is just eating a lot like I usually do and trying to also consume as much protein. Would just eating a lot (think unhealthy stuff swell) and making sure I get in enough protein be enough to gain muscle? My plan is to just eat a shit ton including enough protein and doing a cut in a year or 2. Would that be a good idea or does anyone have any better advice?",

            "Fat and carbs don\u2019t matter as long as you dont consciously minimize either of them. After optimizing protein, the next most important intervention is to get the calories right. You want to gain no more than 1 lb per week on a bulk and lose that same amount on a cut. If you eat enough protein you will gain 70-90% muscle, or lose 70-90% fat. The more you gain per week the more it hurts this number and vice versa, although protein and lifting matters more than how much you are gaining per week in terms of muscle retention and muscle growth. \n\nYou can eat trash food, but it\u2019s not recommended for two main reasons. First, if you gain say two pounds in a single week, you will gain a higher percentage fat, say 50% fat and this means you will have to cut longer and cutting is miserable. Additionally, putting on too much body fat can mess up your hormones and lead you to a higher body fat percentage that your body \u201cwants\u201d to stay at. Second, processed foods and sugar lead you to eat more calories, in the medium and long term by messing with satiety signals among other issues. So while you can eat poorly and still gain exactly a pound per week, it will make the process harder, and when you switch to a cut, you will still have satiety signals messed up so it will make cutting harder. \n\nI would try to keep processed foods to a minimum and sugar to a minimum, and track calories to hit your 1 lb per week, while lifting 4x per week. You can eat out and eat not super healthy food (eg pizza) while doing this, but going full \u201cdirty bulk\u201d is usually a mistake. Lots of people bulk and then struggle to cut and cutting is where your body fat percentage changes. In a bulk, you trend towards 10-30% body fat as you are bulking, then when you cut, you trend towards very low body fat so the cutting is the more important part in terms of how you look. \n\nNote that carbs matter a LOT in terms of water weight, so be conscious of carbs simply for that reason. If you eat healthy and for you that means less carbs, you will lose a bunch of water weight which makes tracking your 1 lb/week difficult since you can lose 5 pounds of water your first week on a low carb diet.",

Lose no more than 1lb per week and gain no more than 1lb per week during cuts and bulks (esp important not to go above 1lb for bulks)\n\nEverything else is secondary.

I avoid doing those last reps and those very heavy lifts. I try to lift with a neutral face where I feel somewhat relaxed. I tend to flex muscles around the neck, face, jaw and shoulders when I go near my limit. This probably contributed to stiffness in these areas.\n* I always do foam rolling of my back and shoulders after working out.\n* I always do stretching for my neck and shoudlers after working out, specifically, I try to stretch my SCM.\n\nI think the first part is the most important.

Intensity and volume so you don\u2019t overtrain as a natural. PPL you can get away with 3-4 days of training, bro split you\u2019ll need 5 days of training. \n\nBut as long as you have your sleep. 7-9 hours. Hydrated throughout the day. Eat your Protien and eat enough to grow and recover and be consistent. Do progressive overload. The split doesn\u2019t really matter but you\u2019ll find yourself inbetween a PPL and bro split.

Fall for the marketing get thicc and mass with upper/ lower training. Not saying it doesn\u2019t work but I absolutely did not like training that way I always found myself going back to try again but if you don\u2019t like the training split it\u2019s not gonna be fun to go to the gym = no progress\n\nMost of the body builders and influencers you look up to do a bro split so it\u2019s pretty universal you gotta tailer it to yourself but it does work just got to make sure you don\u2019t overtrain and can recover properly",

Do cardio for health, not for body composition (lifting is for body composition)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n\n\nIn general your diet doesn't matter beyond a couple parameters so you are over-optimizing:  \n1. Lots of protein, maybe even more than you are getting. The upper bound of the benefit is 2.2g per kg, but you get most the benefit at 1.6g per kg, especially if you are young. Powder is fine for this, but try to get a lot in your food too.  \n2. Don't cut fat or carbs completely, you need those too.  \n3. Avoid sugar, alcohol and processed foods, because while a calorie is a calorie, these foods tend to cause you to eat more over the longterm for various scientific reasons.  \n4. The creatine is a good addition for building muscle, but I wouldn't bother with any other supplements (at least for body composition purposes) and creatine can sometimes cause an acceleration of male pattern baldness if you are predisposed to it. D is fine since most people are low but it doesn't really help with body comp. I wouldn't bother with calcium unless you have a reason like a low blood test. Caffeine is fine if it helps you workout harder.  \n5. Vitamins don't matter, and water volume and variety doesn't matter as long as you have a little bit of variety and aren't dehydrated. Actually the less variable your diet, the less you tend to each, which is how like smoothie only type diets work so well temporarily.  \n6. Find a diet that you can stick too forever, because you don't get to stop after you are done. Only long term diet changes are affective long term.  \n7. The most efficient way to change your body composition is through cutting and bulking (you gain muscle during the bulk, and you lower your body fat percentage during the cut), but since you sound like a beginner you can probably do both at the same time for several months up to a year. If you hit a wall, start bulking and cutting.  \n8. Don't lose more than 1% of your weight per week because you won't be able to stick too it and for people who have trained more, losing weight or putting it on faster results in more muscle loss or fat gain respectively. Slow and steady wins the race. However, DO track your weight so that you are losing at least say .25kg per week while cutting.  \n\n\nAs far as working out goes:  \n1. Weight lifting is far, far more important than cardio, because not only does it burn calories, but more importantly it determines (along with protein) whether you lose muscle or fat when you lose weight, as well as if you gain muscle or fat when you gain weight.  \n2. You sound like you are going to burn yourself out physically (overtraining) with all the hours you are spending. You should be aiming for between 5-10 hard sets of each muscle group per week. You can probably start much closer to 5 because you haven't been training for a really long time. This takes me 4 hours a week, but i go hard. I could probably benefit by 6 hours a week, but the time is not worth the marginal gain for me.  \n3. Consistency is the key because you don't get to stop lifting when you finish or you will revert back (losing your diet will revert you back much faster)  \n4. Compound exercises are much more efficient, but more difficult to get right and stay uninjured... get a trainer for a couple days if you don't have great form and you want to do them.  \n5. Its very important to not get injured, because consistency is the key... The question that will determine your physique in a year is \"how many sets of each muscle did I do this year to close to failure?\" If the answer is 5\\*52 so 104 sets because you didn't get injured and did it every week then you will have great results.  \n\n\nOther:  \n1. Sleep is very important for body fat percentage.  \n2. One more time, permanent changes to your lifestyle are the key. You can super optimize everything and speed up your body fat changes, but it reverts back super quickly if you don't maintain it. So for example, maybe you cut out 100% of junk food and that gets you 2% lower on body fat, and you lift 4 days a week and that gets you 2% lower, and you add up all these little advantages and you get down to 15% where you can see abs. Then you realize that you don't want to never eat dessert again for the rest of your life so you add a little bit back in, then you realize that you only have time to workout 3 days a week so you add a little bit back in, and very quickly you are at 17% body fat. If you don't think you can maintain a lifestyle change (and your prescribed diet is definitely something that is hard to maintain) then its better to just skip it now because in the end, you will have the body fat percentage that reflects your longterm, sustained lifestyle, so why kill yourself when you will end up at 17% anyways."

            "I was about where you were and researched the science of this extensively. It really all depends on how you decide to do it.   \n\n\nThe way I did it, is the most time efficient and its with bulking/cutting, but you can also do it, by going really slow. Bulking/cutting looks like this empirically (my experience was roughly the average in studies): You can gain about 1 lb of muscle per week, but you will put on about .3 lbs of fat while doing that. This means your body fat percentage will stay the same or even go up slightly during bulking (since 23% of the new weight is fat). Then you switch to cutting and its the reverse, you lose 1.3lbs per week, but its 1lb of fat and .3 lbs of muscle. Which means that you will be reducing body fat percentage significantly during this time period. If you are 200lbs, and 46lbs are fat, then after 12 weeks you will be 184 lbs with 34lbs of fat or 18.5% body fat.  \n\n\nThere are some important caveats. Studies suggest people can gain 70-90% muscle or lose 70-90% fat. I used 77% because that was typical for me. Additionally, you need to be lifting hard a lot to do this... I'd up it to 4x per week, although 3 probably works (cardio doesn't really matter very much). Third, you need to be eating a lot of protein... the more, the better until you hit .8-1.2g per lb of body weight. I just shoot for 1g/lb and if I miss by a tiny bit its fine. Another caveat is that you can put on muscle without bulking, it will just happen much slower, but you will gain a higher percentage of muscle. I don't know the numbers here, but I think its realistic to gain 1lb of total weight every 4 weeks, but its 90% muscle so you are actually going down in body fat percentage. Some people advocate cutting until you hit your ideal percentage body fat and then adding muscle very slowly like I just laid out.  \n\n\nThe two hardest parts are cutting, because if you cut at the speed I suggested you really feel terrible during the process. If you do everything right you can cut pretty quickly and its more effecient, but slower cuts have advantages in that you lose a higher percentage of fat and its possibly easier to maintain. The very hardest part in my experience is maintaining the lower body fat percentage. You don't get to just stop doing all the things that got you there. You don't have to cut, but basically have to continue to work out like a fiend and to eat well, or you will end up right back where you were.",
            "Dude, thank you SO MUCH. This is exactly the information I\u2019ve been looking for. I understand things better when the facts are laid out like this and know how to incorporate scientific info when I have it, but don\u2019t have the background to sort through the data myself.\n\nI don\u2019t need to be ripped; I have a small frame (5\u20196\u2019\u2019) so I\u2019m cool with putting on a bit more fat while gaining 1lb muscle per week (if I\u2019m gunna be short I gotta be wide) I\u2019m going to try bulking then cutting the way you\u2019ve laid out and go from there. 4x/week is doable for me for sure.\n\nAs for the protein intake: I\u2019ve found I struggle pretty consistently to get past 130g/day, but if I\u2019m 170 I need to get this up to 170g/day, correct? And be in a surplus of 3000cal/week roughly?",
            "protein powder goes a long way and doesn't come with that many calories. Also,  you'll probably be fine with less protein (1g per lb is like what bodybuilders max out at, but there are diminishing returns so if you get to .6g-.8 per lb you get most of the gains).  \n\n\nBe careful to not put on weight too fast, or without the hard lifting, or you will find yourself getting fatter as you get bigger. Also, when you first start lifting (or after a hiatus) you really don't need to eat a surplus to add muscle, so just be careful when you bulk. Lots of people bulk and then try to cut and fail bc that is the hard part, so make sure you actually do both if you are doing one.  \n\n\nLast thing I will say is that 23% bf is enough that you could consider cutting first or getting your beginner gains first (if those are available). You don't want to go crazy with it, but if your goal is to look good, cutting goes further than bulking and people seem to find it much easier to bulk than cut.  \n\n\nProtein has 4 calories per gram so 170\\*4 = 680 calories.",

I think I\u2019ll see how I go for 3 months and watch how I eat while adding more protein then cut over the winter. At 23% I know I need to lose weight, but getting stronger and having more to show is aesthetically important since I\u2019m not going for the \u201cshredded\u201d look.",

I do feel a ton in my shoulders from the bent over reverse flys and I can barely do any weight in that exercise so it seems like a weak spot.\n\nFor core exercises do you think planks, bicycle crunches, and maybe leg lifts would be enough?",
            "Pullups are amazing and important so I would get one.  It does a lot of the muscles that rows do, but fairly different emphasis. However, you should definitely be trying to get ATLEAST as much pull exercises as push ones. Actual athletes often do 2-to-1 pull. Right now your pull exercises are curls and reverse flys which are both pretty small lifts, while you are doing 4 types of push excercises which includes 2 big lifts. I'd say right now. So if you count big movements twice for simplicity, you are doing 3-1 push exercises.  \n\n\nIt might be that your DBs don't get heavy enough for rows, but you can make it harder by doing more reps or doing the movement slower with a fuller range of motion.  \n\n\nHow much weight you can do on an exercise doesn't mean that area is weak or strong. Reverse flys use way less muscles than rows, (ie less compound) so its harder to do more weight. I'd also follow a youtube video to get rows exactly correct. In general, compound exercises are way better for a lot of reasons including that they are more time efficient because they hit more muscles, they are more functional to real life, and they get a better hormone response (more stress, so more recovery including increases in test.).  \n\n\nI think your core stuff is good, just make sure you are using abdominal pressure while performing them (and any big lift). This is important for not hurting yourself on any lift.   \n\n\nChest is more important to physique and that is what most people are going for, so I think its reasonable to prioritize that somewhat, but if you don't balance it out with pull exercises, especially rows and things like facepulls it will eventually cause you shoulder issues during military press and ruin your posture.  \n\n\nFinal thought: You want to load in as many compound movements as you can and I think you are a little low on those right now. For example, if you do compound movements your biceps will grow somewhat anyways because of all the hormonal effects and the fact that some of them will hit arms a little bit. (still do curls if you want big arms though)  \n\n\nSecond, you want as many pull as push exercises.  \n\n\nThird, there are DB routines online that balance all this stuff for you.",

If you're overworking a group, you're giving adequate stress to a muscle group but not allowing it enough rest time to fully recover and grow before running it through another workout. This could either result in injury or your body compensates and just stops you from performing as you did when exercising refreshed. Ever notice a correlation between how sore you are and your body's performance?\n\nAlso, in regards to the type of exercises, if you aren't training to lift heavy then expect your body to adapt to what you are putting it through. \n\nLastly, any time I am returning to a workout routine I go through a similar slump in performance. I feel it's just your body getting back into the rhythm of this \"break it down, build it back up\" cycle that happens as we work out. So don't let it slow you down! Just listen to your body in terms of giving it a break if you need it, eat right, and get plenty of sleep and water."

Don't know if you want to lose fat, but I don't do cardio myself as I'm pretty skinny build. Would recommend doing it on off days.\n3. For starting lifting weights, always start light and get a good form. There are a ton of YouTube videos on how to get a good form. I would recommend starting with weights you can do at least 3 sets of 10 reps with. Over time, you can increase.\n4. Just a sports shirt and sports shorts. Shoes don't really matter, as long you're not training on those pointy shoes. Nikes, adidas or Jordans always work.\n5. If you have an inury just take more rest days, but I really don't know much about that topic. Or try to work out other muscles\n6. See point 5",

You need a solid workout plan where you focus on heavy compound movements (I would recommend a push pull legs split) and then I would start counting macros tailored to your goals.

Most people lean forward in their chairs and then look down with there neck.\n\nSo an overall total body routine with stretching and mobility and weights with a focus on shoulder mobility will help with all that.\n\nThe website you listed is a great way to start implementing stretches. a few exercises I wouldn\u2019t do. But overall most are Great for beginners or to start off with. I would probably focus on lower back for posture and most with stretches that utilze above and behind the head for the shoulders \n\nPick 3-4 stretches. And go through them daily. You can alternate other stretches on certain days or rotate them during the week. So you don\u2019t get bored but have 2-3 as a go to for stretches to do daily",

I eat very clean, and avoid putting junk into my body. If I tried to bulk, what tips could you give me?

Legs generally are 50/50 from knee down to knee up, having a longer femur makes squatting a little bit more challenging. If this is the case, try using flat shoes when training leg and check your technique again. You just CANT go as deep as others, that doesnt mean you are not working the cuads. You dont need to go as deep to get the same muscle recruitment. 90 degrees will suffice, and dont be afraid to let your knees pass your toes, long femur trainees tend to be afraid to do this because of balance ans confort. You Will probably need to train with less weight a couple of weeks, need to experiment what feels right. Squat is a highly genetic dependant compound, meaning proportions and structure can hinder or benefit greatly. If nothing works, you can just leave squat as an accesory and work harder on other excercises like Bulgarian Split Squat.\n\n\nLastly, Achilles tendon stretches and knee strengthening. For people with shorter legs, achilles tendon is not an obstacle, for us, probably a lot more.\n\n\nIf long lengs are not the culprit then I would just suggest checking your technique over and over again.\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/CTMLOj_5x1M",

You can do so much with a set of dumbbells that you can programme your workouts to be different every time.   \n\n\nYou feel the benefits of these new movements, but the novelty of different workouts keeps you motivated and you are inspired because you see your trajectory of learning and the subsequent growth.

You should recover from this after a couple of nights assuming you get back on track with your scheduled rest.  \n\nDon't let this demotivate you too much.  It's a regular part of a fit lifestyle.  Managing stiffness, soreness, and overall discomfort is an important process.  But, just like a blister on your foot, negative feelings need to be dealt with and treated.  Reflect on the possible reasons why you had trouble sleeping.  Do you have a big exam coming up?  Did you eat something that didn't go down well? Did you have a headache?  Was your body sore from the workout? Try to come up with a plan for avoiding those in the future.  \n\nIf this is something that you've had a problem with for a while I would suggest going to a sleep clinic.  I had sleep troubles for many years and it was an anchor that affected my progress significantly. Apparently, the brain releases HGH into the body only during deep sleep.  It's logical that this is done to help with muscle recovery. If you sleep poorly you're basically missing out on that."

Generally however, most, including me, would say it's not a myth. \n\nIf your goal is to build muscle or maintain muscle, then you need to give your muscles time to rest. You see one thing we do know is that, muscle isn't built when you're lifting weights, it's built on the days you're resting. If you train the same muscle everyday, you're not giving it enough time to rest and grow. \n\nSome muscles however, can take more of a beating than others. Such as the medial deltoid (side of your shoulder), Posterior deltoids (back of your shoulder) and Calves. These muscles can be trained daily, depending on your goals. \n\nAlso, there's the factor of motivation. Can you stay motivated to train each muscle everyday, or would that burn you out? Personally, I think it would have negative effects on the general trainee's approach to lifting. Having those days off allows you to recuperate and look forward to your next training day. You can also do a little stretching and recovery work to prep you for said training day.\n\nAs a general rule, each muscle should be trained to failure twice a week with at least 24-48 hours rest in-between sessions. This can be achieved by using a split or full body program. Which one you choose depends on your experience level and schedule."

            "> Why do sets have a fixed amount of reps?\n\nThis is a general purpose approach that fulfills many goals, the main utility is that it's easy to record and track. You can vary the weight or other factors with straight sets and it's simple to mathematically contrast.\n\n> Why can I not just do reps until I feel that I absolutely can't anymore, for 3 sets?\n\nThis is a viable strategy but more for hypertrophy than strength or muscular endurance. Taking sets to near failure is a steady driver of muscle growth, but that's not going to help if that's not what your goals are defined as.\n\nThat said, while training to failure every so often can be useful to gauge your technical failure point, training to failure in general is not effective ([source 1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36334240/), [source 2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26666744/), [source 3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33497853/), [source 4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33555822/), [source 5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35658845/), [source 6](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36178597/)).

Try 1-2kg or even 0.5kg.\n\nIf you can't adjust the weight in such small measures, then focus on increasing your total reps per exercise. When you aggregate effective work, it doesn't matter if you have straight sets or not when total reps is the important metric to progress (i.e. 3x8-12 vs 5x6).",
            "They are commonly called AMRAP sets (As Many Reps as Possible).  They are fantastic.  My morning workout heavily involves them because reaching failure is guaranteed to wake me up fully.  For example,  I set a target rep count like 50 pushups and I keep doing AMRAP sets until I reach that goal.  On difficult mornings it takes 5 sets.  On great mornings it only takes 2 sets.  It really depends on how I'm feeling at that time.\n\nBefore attempting an AMRAP set just clearly define what is failure.  Do this to prevent injury.  Otherwise, if it's not defined you might push beyond failure which could result in injury.  You can spot people doing that from a mile away.  They are usually grunting and groaning and performing reps with poor form just to finish off their current set.  That is an easy recipe for an injury.  The ideal is to not hurt yourself and to keep training but stop just before failure.  I define failure as whenever my rep form breaks down.\n\nI find they are fairly useful when doing circuit training.  You can program to perform an exercise for a length of time rather than a number of reps.  This way I'm not counting reps I'm just listening for the beep from my stopwatch.  I can focus my mind on my rep form and my effort.  You can find many examples of circuit training on youtube.",

            "This is actually a surprisingly good starting point for someone asking this question. Here's a copy pasta of what I usually post for people asking this question. It's pretty similar to what you're doing. It might explain sike things a little better for you. The biggest issue with calisthenics is people get into routines doing extremely high rep sets instead of progressing to harder motions and keeping the reps in the 5-25 range. \n\nCalisthenics\n\nThe basic way to build a workout is to focus on compound movements and make those movements your \u201cprimary or main\" movements and then use accessory or secondary lifts to address imbalances, deficiencies, and compliment your main movements. You want 10\u201320 sets per week for each muscle group which typically works out to hitting each muscle group 2x a week. The lifting schedule you choose is called a split. The most common splits are 1) fully body 3x a week 2)upper-lower split 4x a week 3) PPL (push, pull, legs) 6x a week 4) bro split or Arnold Split 6x a week.\n\nYou want to select compound exercises in the primary planes of movement for pushing and pulling movements. So you've got horizontal push (examples; bench press, pushups, chest press machines) horizontal pull (examples; barbell row, bodyweight row, machine rows). Vertical push (overhead press, dips, shoulder press machine). Vertical pull (pull ups, lat pull down machine). Legs (barbell squat, leg press, lunges) and hamstrings (straight leg deadlift, bodyweight/Nordic curl, GHR machine). \n\nFor calisthenics your main movements are; Pushups, inverted rows, dips, pullups, squats, lunges. For each workout your want to do 4\u20136 sets of each exercise. After a light warmup do your first 2\u20133 sets of a difficult variation of the exercise in the 5\u20138 rep range. For pushups and rows that might be raised feet, for pullups and dips you might add weight like chains, a weight vest, or a simple belt and loading pin setup with regular weights. Squats and lunges are a bit more difficult to load but you can do unilateral exercises. \n\nAfter your 2\u20133 \u201cheavy\" sets do 2\u20133 volume sets in the 10\u201315 rep range. For the volume work you can make the exercise easier to hit the desired reps. For pushups and rows you raise the upper body higher than the feet. For pullups and dips add bands. Squats and lunges should be easy enough but you can hold onto something and pull yourself up if you can't do 15 of them.\nThe thing with calisthenics is that they are easy to get started with but the progression is exponentially difficult. To change your appearance you need to constantly push progression. People think \u201cI'll just do 100 pushups a day and get jacked\" but that's not how it works. Especially with high rep workouts. High reps won't do much to change your appearance. They will improve athleticism and burn some calories but if you can do 40 pushups without stopping vs 100 you won't necessarily look any different. If your body fat percentage is too high you'll also fail to progress. The key to any workout is change and progression. With calisthenics you need to do your research and learn different progressions of each movement so you're pushing that progress. There's a ton available on YouTube. \n\nHere's a basic template;\n\nMonday upper body #1 ; Pushup and bw row are your primary and pull-up and dip are your secondary.\n\n1) 10-15 min warmup, jumping jacks, jump rope whatever gets you ready to do pushups, it shoudn't be hard. \n2) Hard pushups: 2-3 sets no more than 8 reps. If you can do 3 sets of 8 then you need to make the variation harder. Start with 2 sets of 5 reps.\n3) Easy pushups: 2-3 sets 15-20 reps. If you can do 3 sets of 20 reps make the variation harder next time you do pushups.\n4) Hard bodyweight rows: 2-3 sets of 8 reps. Follow the same structure as with the pushups.\n5) Easy bodyweight rows: 2-3 sets 15-20 reps.\n6) Pullups: 2-3 easy sets or do a \"ladder progression.\" (That's another copypasta I'll add)\n7) Dips: 2-3 easy sets or do a ladder progression.\n\nTuesday: lower body #1\n1) Warmup\n2) Hard squats: 2-3 sets 5-8 reps.\n3) Easy squats: 2-3 sets 15-20 reps.\n4) Hard lunges: 2-3 sets 5-8 reps.\n5) Easy lunges: 2-3 sets 15-20 reps.\n6) Nordic curls: easy 2-3 sets 15-20 reps.\n7) Box jumps/stationary jumps: ladder progression.\n8) ab circuit any 3 exercises or ab wheel 3 sets 10-15 reps.\n\nWednesday: rest\n\nThursday: upper body #2\n1) warmup\n2) Hard dips: 2-3 sets 5-8 reps.\n3) Easy dips: 2-3 sets 15-20 reps.\n4) Hard pullups: 2-3 sets 5-8 reps.\n5) Easy pullups: 2-3 sets 15-20 reps.\n6) Easy Pushups: 2-3 sets 15-20 reps or ladder progression\n7) Easy rows: 2-3 sets 15-20 reps or ladder progression. \n\nFriday: lower body #2\n1) Warmup\n2) Hard squats: 2-3 sets 5-8 reps.\n3) Easy squats: 2-3 sets 15-20 reps.\n4) Hard lunges: 2-3 sets 5-8 reps.\n5) Easy lunges: 2-3 sets 15-20 reps.\n6) Nordic curls: easy 2-3 sets 15-20 reps.\n7) Box jumps/stationary jumps: ladder progression.\n8) ab circuit any 3 exercises or ab wheel 3 sets 10-15 reps.\n\nThe challenge of this and any bodyweight program is finding the variations to hit the right rep ranges. If you're a beginner \"girl pushups\" might be your hard variation and wall pushups might be your easy variation. Or maybe regular push-ups your hard and girl Pushups your easy. To make pushups easier raise your hands higher so wall pushups would be the easiest variation. To make them harder raise your feet so hands stand pushups would be the hardest variation. You also have options like diamond pushups, tight elbows in, wide hands, one arm etc. Bodyweight rows work the same way; raise the hand grip to make them easier and raise the feet to make them harder. For squats and lunges your have single leg versions like Bulgarian split squats, you can do wide stance squats or long step lunges, and of course weighted and single leg versions. Do your research! \n\nI also typically do back to back sets for the upper body workout. So I'll do my hard pushup variation and then my hard row variation. Then easy pushups paired with easy rows. I'm pair my pullups and dips too. \n\nIf you have Zero equipment you can still start without the pull-ups and dips. You'll have to get creative with the rows but you can use a sturdy table or anything around the house you can hang from. A cheap doorway pull-up bar can go a long way. They have versions with dip attachments as well. They also have relatively cheap pull-up and dip stations you can fit in the corner of most rooms. If you don't want to mark up your door frame tape the contact points with gorilla tape. You can also get a cheap pair of gymnastic rings and straps to hang from a door pull-up attachment, just be careful. The rings are a bonus bc you can use them for hard variation pushups too. \n\nThis is getting long but lastly you can turn this into a 3x a week program by hitting the full body every day. If time is a concern you can just do two upper body exercises hard and easy sets and the to lower body hard and easy sets. Alternate your upper body exercises with each workout."

I've tried these exercises, and they seem to be causing more discomfort and tightness rather than relief. So my question is, is this a real concept? Is it rooted in actual exercise science?

With proper range of motion and intensity, resistance training also provides improved flexibility and mobility but that's also programming and methodology dependent. However, isolated static stretching programs can improve flexibility on problem areas.\n\nIf you've been doing exercises like deadlifts, squats, hip thrusts, and some core-focused exercises like hanging leg raises, or really anything with a hinge movement (and maybe isolated adduction and abduction movements) with the right intensity, frequency, and programming then you should potentially have had all the stimulus you need for healthy hip flexion.

With any program you need to be hitting the major movement patterns.

Of course if you have low bodyfat, exercises that promote abdominal hypertrophy will help make abs visual. Planks don't facilitate ab hypertrophy so they're particularly unproductive if that's your goal. A better alternative would be an ab wheel which works the same muscles and the eccentric and concentric mission will facilitate hypertrophy. \n\nImo personal trainers like planks bc it gives them a bit of downtime and they feel difficult so they can be a tool for active rest especially in fast paced boot camp style workouts which I think are generally bad for most people (but that's another discussion).\n\nImo you shouldn't be doing ab isolations unless you're already doing a full body program.

As the other commenter mentioned you want to meet your protein goal while staying under the calorie target (which normally means being selective about the foods that you eat) to minimize losing muscle while you're losing fat.\n\nHowever, if you don't have a lot of body fat and want to gain weight, then your calorie target will be higher, but you still want to meet your protein goal to build muscle.\n\nThe way I understand it, it's difficult to build a lot of muscle and lose a lot of fat at the same time, so people tend to do one first (e.g. \"cut\" - or lose weight/fat) and then the other (\"bulk\" or gain weight/muscle)\n\nPersonally, I avoided tracking foods (mainly because I was too lazy) for decades, and even though I worked out quite a bit and generally ate healthily, I always felt fatter/heavier than I wanted to be.

My current weight is 185 and I couldn't be happier. I don't know if I'll ever break 200lbs without adding a lot of fat but 190 isn't far off for me now. It's pretty surprising the reactions I get from people since I've put on some mass. People just assume I workout and will randomly ask me about it. Like I said, I've been doing some form of training for most of my life. It feels good to finally have some people acknowledge it. No one could see how sweet my boxing combos were or how I could slay a boot camp class but they do see my gains lol.",

But if you reach the point where you almost faint/puke or almost get injured, but don't reach the point (while getting near it), it's those key moments that really bring out the most gains be they strength or hypertrophic.

Only eating enough protein is not adequate.\n\nIf you are a beginner/noob it could seem like you are building muscle while in a deficit.  What typically happens you build muscle and burn fat.  Muscle is much heavier than fat the number on the scale quickly goes up.  Beginners usually have very little muscle mass.  So in the first year of training, they might quintuple their muscle mass. This can be frustrating if that is the only method for judging your progress.  Pair that with making mistakes/misjudgments on diet and boom the number on the scale goes up even more.

Eventually I decided that it wasn't worth the effort to limit my diet that strictly and eat that few calories to continue to lower my bodyfat.

Now I've gone the other direction and I've been packing on as much strength and muscle mass as I can the last few years. Genetically I've always been very lean and for the first time I look like a guy that goes to the gym. I have a flat stomach and some muscle and I'm fine with it. I've had several people comment on it (mostly older men, and I'm a dude lol) and I feel better than ever. I was looking at some older pictures with my wife the other day and she mentioned how skinny I was back then. She's always liked the way I look but she does seem to really like the bigger version of me. For reference I'm 180-185lbs at 5'10.5\" so we're talking a pretty big difference from my boxing days. Now that I have more muscle mass it may actually be easier for me to get the ripped abs because my TDEE is naturally higher.

I'm just saying you can be happy and healthy and probably get more of a reaction from other people by putting on some mass.

I recommend also, once you are experienced and ready enough for a challenge,  to superset the 2 together, doing presses with a free weight bar or dumbells and then immediately starting presses on the smith machine with little to no rest between the 2 exercises and long rest after both are complete and repeat the superset 3-4 times.

I have asthma and a bit of a high resting heart rate and want to try and improve my lung strength and lower my resting heart rate. I'm very much a beginner so I don't know how much to do.

            "In my opinion, if you want to see changes in something related to your health, whether it\u2019s through diet, cardio, lifting, etc, you shouldn\u2019t think of it as \u201chow much\u201d but as a change in lifestyle. Meaning you will be doing this diet/cardio/etc from now on. This is because what\u2019s the point of dieting for 6 months and then going back to your old habits? Not to mention that a few months of cardio hardly cancels out decades of sedentary lifestyle. Luckily, the opposite is true as well. Basically what I\u2019m trying to say is just go for it, incorporate cardio into your life and over time you can probably work up to running a marathon if you wanted to. I\u2019m not sure how much you would have to do before any meaningful outcomes happen. \n\nSomething I want to note is that since you\u2019re not actually training like an athlete would to perform at a specific level, you don\u2019t have to push yourself to the limit in cardio sessions to see results like you would with weightlifting. As long as you are running around it is effective, so choose a pace that is enjoyable. The most important variable is consistency. Going for a run twice a week should be more than enough, assuming you do so every week. If you want, I really enjoy timing myself and recording it in a spreadsheet just to see if I\u2019m getting faster, even though I\u2019m not explicitly trying to.\nHope this helps",

I don't know how much I've gained, but I've definitely packed on muscle as well.  My parents gave me a hand-me-down fitbit.  When I first got it 2 months ago, my resting heart rate was 57.  That was after 2 months of exercise.  Now, 2 months later, my heart rate is 51-53 range.  I think the only way I can get that lower is to lose some more weight, which I'm still trying to do.",

Pick one and enter the information it asks, like age, sex, weight, activity level, etc. \n\nFinally it'll pull up a number of calories and that's your BMR. Now, what does \"Basal Metabolic Rate\" mean? Well, that's how many calories your body would burn if you did absolutely NOTHING for 24 hours, i.e. laying in bed and never getting up. If 99% of your time is spent stationary, then this number will be pretty accurate to how many calories you burn a day (excluding walking to fridge, car, etc.)\n\nNow, with everything accounted for (let's just say an extra 50 or so calories for walks), you should eat 200-300 calories below that number to lose fat. Don't eat any less or it can cause serious problems with energy, deficiencies, muscle atrophy for what muscle you do have, etc, and you should see some fat loss in the coming weeks.

Either your bench or your pushups or both have poor form.  I suggest to perform each rep at half speed and with half of the weight.  Focus on having absolute perfect form.  After a few sets you should feel muscle activation in your chest, arm, front and rear delts.  I had a similar problem where my arms were doing most of the work for each pushup.  Muscle development was slowed signifivantly.  My bench sucked as well.  My form was piss poor and things only improved when i improved my pushups form.  \n\nFor pushups, it's very simple to improve your form.  Perform each rep slowly.  Start in a plank position, lower your body all the way down to the ground, raise your hands up off the ground and flex/tense your back, lower your hands press your body upwards to complete the rep.  This method is great for improving your form.",

            "Protien should be a big priority, track it as best you can. Try to keep it at 1.6 - 2.2g protien per kilogram of bodyweight \n(E.g. I am 58kg so I aim for above 93g, usually aiming for 120 - 130g)\nThis can be difficult to achieve at first but as you learn more it does get easier. \n\nImportant to drink heaps of water, of course. Especially with higher protien. \n\nCreatine is great at any stage, it's the most researched supplement. That research shows overwhelming positives and little negatives. Only thing I'd be wary of is reports of water retention when you first start, depends on if you think that will affect your cut or not. It will be water, not fat. \n\nAlso, consider if your calorie deficit is too high. Not saying I think it is, I haven't enough information to even speculate that and I wouldnt comment even if i did. Simply a factor you may want to look into is all, as losing weight too fast will definately lead to muscle loss, which can lead to that \"skinny fat\" look.  \nIdeally, if time isn't a factor, the best way to lose fat while retaining muscle is slowly. As slow as you can while still seeing results. \n\nConservative - moderate deficit\nKeep protien high, be smart about it \nDo some form of weight/resistance training \nAvoid excessive cardio (this will shed weight, but that weight is unlikely to all be fat)\nRest well & recover well. Extra important in a deficit. \n\nHope this helps and good luck with your goals\n\nEditing to add it could be beneficial to add in a multivitamin, even a probiotic if you are in deficit \n\nAlso wanted to say something that really helped me as someone who was also afraid of getting bulky once apon a time; \nBuilding muscle is hard. Its hard to do deliberately, let alone if you aren't aiming for it or actively trying to avoid it. It's very unlikely to just accidentally happen. Don't be afraid of weights, protien, all of that. You need some muscle to look lean and toned.",

A few weeks ago, I noticed a small twinge of pain in my upper left hip (around where the leg joint is) after my last set of squats. I wrote it off as it wasn't too bad and it went away pretty fast. However, the next leg day, I felt the same pain on my first working set. I decided to do one more set to see if it would get worse and...holy fuck did it get worse. I took about 1.5 weeks off to let whatever happened heal, but I tried legs again just yesterday and felt the same twinge during my warm-up sets.

I had thought that if I ate pretty close to maintenance, I could make strength\n\nYes, yes, and yes. You can make strength gains on any sort of diet (outside of a really steep deficit.) If you aren't gaining strength, eating more can help a little, but most people who are plateauing in strength just need to train harder and/or smarter.\n\nIt sounds like you have a good handle on the tradeoffs of OMAD. If you have athletic goals, I'd say muscle growth has larger and more meaningful benefits than fasting, but that's ultimately a judgement call for you. In your place the first thing I would consider would be carbs before (and/or during) training. They'll get used by your body pretty much immediately, so that your physiological state won't be that different than when you're fasting. A small carb/protein meal could help you hit your protein timing goals as well."

            "The basic way to build a workout is to focus on compound movements and make those movements your \u201cprimary or main\" movements and then use accessory or secondary lifts to address imbalances, deficiencies, and compliment your main movements. You want 10\u201320 sets per week for each muscle group which typically works out to hitting each muscle group 2x a week. The lifting schedule you choose is called a split. The most common splits are 1) fully body 3x a week 2)upper-lower split 4x a week 3) PPL (push, pull, legs) 6x a week 4) bro split or Arnold Split 6x a week.\n\nYou want to select compound exercises in the primary planes of movement for pushing and pulling movements. So you've got horizontal push (examples; bench press, pushups, chest press machines) horizontal pull (examples; barbell row, bodyweight row, machine rows). Vertical push (overhead press, dips, shoulder press machine). Vertical pull (pull ups, lat pull down machine). Legs (barbell squat, leg press, lunges) and hamstrings (straight leg deadlift, bodyweight/Nordic curl, GHR machine). \n\nThose are your main exercises. You pick one from each category and do 3-5 sets for each day you're hitting that given area based on the split you're doing. If you're doing full body chances are these will be the only exercise you're doing or your workouts will take forever. Full body is frequently recommended for beginners. If you're doing an upper-lower split you can add in some isolation movements for arms and shoulders. PPL and Bro split are intermediate to advanced programs that will also include more isolation movements.\n\nThe reps and sets are where your program can really differ. Generally if you're doing higher reps (10-15) you can get away with less sets (2-3). If you're doing lower reps (5-8) you'll do more sets 3-5. You want the weight to be challenging no matter what two range you're working in. Some people will talk about \"low weight high reps\" but that's just low weight relative to the number of reps your doing. The weight should always be challenging. If you're doing over 20 reps you're probably going too light with the weight and not stimulating much in terms of muscle growth or strength gains. Personally I like to do 2-3 sets in the low rep range and 2-3 sets in the higher rep ranges for my main lifts.",

            "Here's my copypasta on habit building. Imo it's the most important part of making a lasting change and I rarely hear it talked about.\nThe most important thing is consistency and getting \"addicted\" to the consistency and how rewarded it makes you feel to do something positive for yourself. Set aside time every other day for \"active periods\" don't worry about the workout or progress. Set your timer for a period that isn't daunting like 15-30mins and don't let yourself stop until time is up. The active period could be household chores without looking at your phone or sitting down, yardwork, walking your dog or just walking yourself. Do this routine until you feel anxious about missing an active period, maybe a month, maybe more. If your schedule forces you to miss an active period just make it up the next day, no stress. When it's a habit and you no longer struggle to complete active periods you can look into actual workouts. Do the same thing with your workouts though.\n\n I've trained at martial arts and boxing gyms most of my adult life and seen a lot of people new to fitness take fitness classes at these places. Most of these classes go too hard too soon and people never seem to last. It's a double edged sword for these types of classes because people want to feel like they're getting a good workout but what they need is to slowly add intensity and back off when it gets to be too much. \n\nStart with a 1-3 months of active period habit building. Remember you're in this for the long haul. You don't want to start off and quit. Build the habit first and slowly add on intensity over time. Your have your whole life to exercise and ultimately you need exercise and physical activity just about every day. \n\nThe secret no one in the fitness community tells you is that anyone who is fit and has sustained it for a long time has successfully incorporated a regular habit of physical activity into their lifestyle. Make prioritizing fitness a habit and it can serve you the rest of your life.",
            "Totally agree with what the other poster shared.  I would like to add what has worked for me.  Setting three kinds of goals all at once is ideal.  Today's goals, the years goals, and your life goals are the three kinds.  The reason this is important is that to feel good about yourself you'll have to grow as a person and to grow you'll need to overcome your own challenges.  In our modern age the temptation to quit and procrastinate is something most of us deal with.  So when times get tough you'll need every reason to persist.  Your goals can be your reason.  This way you are establishing a baseline of integrity with yourself and you will eventually witness how your hard work every day is bringing you closer to your life goals.  So there should be synergy between the three kinds of goals.  Todays goals could be to complete a workout, yearly goals could be to lose 25 pounds of fat, lifelong goals could be to look great with your shirt off and attract a partner you are attracted to as well.  This is just an example to prove a point.  So when you are half way through a tough workout and the temptation to quit and procrastinate is in your mind you'll have several reasons to keep going.  This has been so helpful for me especially during hard cardio.  Then each tough task you complete will be a reminder that you are someone who is working to acheive your goals.  You are what you do in life and not the thoughts you think.  Atomic Habits by James Clear is a great book on this topic.\n\nPicture a typical depressed person who skips this.  When they are in the middle of a difficult task the rationalization to quit and procrastinate is so much easier.  Theres even a meme about this.  It's typical that gym membership sales spike each January but gym attendance dwindles throughout the year.  Most likely the quitters didn't set meaningful goals on New Years Eve.  If they even bothered they might have set a bland, generic goal that almost means nothing.  \"I just want to lose some weight\" is a good example of a shitty goal.  You can always start losing \"some\" weight tomorrow.  So setting a goal like that is almost setting yourself up to fail later.  Don't be like that.\n\nYour goals need to be set by YOU,  They are personal and they need to make sense deep down in your soul.  Looking them up on the internet or getting them prescribed to you by someone else just does not make sense.  If you are struggling to come up with your own goals just start small.  Writing a list of 5 things you admire in others is a great start.  That list can inspire your other goals and in turn the entire direction of your life.\n\nThis is a very difficult journey but my goodness it's rewarding and exciting.  I nearly cried tears of joy when I completed my first pullup.  Check out David Goggins he has overcome many difficulties through completing tough workouts. He has been a big influence on my life and many others.\n\n[It's You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqQ0vp_o96E)\n\n[Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFAIQfu62WY)\n\nFor equipment I would suggest simple things.  A yoga mat, running shoes, pullup bar, and alarm clock would be a great starting kit.  Goodluck my friend.",
            "Something that helps me is having a physical calendar to track when I've worked out. I have it in my room, it's a huge monthly dry erase board that stares me in the face haha. It helps me stay consistent. If you try and are still unable to remain consistent then it might just bring you down every time you look at it so.. make sure to do what works for you.\n\nAnother thing I do when I have to do something I don't entirely want to is I complain excessively in my head about how much I don't want to do it while simultaneously starting to do it. It's a little weird but works for me.\n\nSomething I catch myself doing a lot after taking an unintentional break from exercise is thinking to myself \"man, if only I had started doing this a year ago! Imagine how good I'd be now!\" Well, instead of looking BACK during those times, look FORWARDS and realize that a year from now will pass and you can either work out during that year or not. The cool thing about time is that it just keeps going. Eventually time will pass and it's more a matter of whether you decided to do something along the way.\n\nOf course with mental issues it's hard to \"decide\" to do something so go easy on yourself. Like another person said, you're in this for the long haul. Not for the next month, or year or 3 years but your whole life! So if you're inconsistent and don't work out for a week or month or however long then look forwards not back, don't be hard on yourself"

Add in some circuit exercises like battle ropes and medicine ball exercises for a complete workout.\n* Decide on a rep range based on your goals and level of experience, a common starting point for building muscle is 8-12 reps.\n* Incorporate cardio into your routine by doing it either before or after your strength training, or on separate days. Aim for at least 2-3 days of cardio per week.\n* Use an app or program that provides pre-made workouts and tracks your progress. A few popular options include MyFitnessPal, JEFIT, and Nike Training Club.\n* Don't be afraid to seek help from a personal trainer or fitness professional if you need guidance on form or how to progress your workouts.\n\nRemember, consistency is key and finding a routine that you enjoy and can stick to is most important.

            "What you want is basically what everyone wants and there's no shortage of people willing to sell it to you. The reality is that training for strength and muscle mass is one end of the spectrum and stamina and cardio is the other end. There are a ton of people that will tell you that you can do both. You can do both things inefficiently that's for sure. I've been there and done that. I've spent my evenings for most of my adult life training martial arts and combat sports at gyms and I've seen a lot and tried a lot. If you want muscle mass but don't want to do barbells, or machines you might never reach your goal. Unless you're already athletic or genetically gifted you're probably not going to get there with light dumbbells, kettlebells, battle ropes and circuit training. If your diet is in check you can definitely lose weight and look good. In my experience though most people who get into the \"boot camp\" style of training are just trying to outrun a shitty diet. That style of training is so grueling that attrition tends to be high and people rarely last six months. \n\nIm the same age as you. Imo the best way to make a lasting change is focus on strength and muscle building and add in a few days of cardio after you've been consistent with your workouts over six months. I can lay out how to do it and maybe point you to some good resources but I really don't want to waste my time writing a wall of text for nothing. Ill  just say that after having kids and having to cut back on going to the gym several nights a week I've been able to make more progress by just focusing on strength and hypertrophy training 4x a week in 35-45minute sessions of pretty comfortable paced workouts."

You say your protein comes mostly from shakes which is also not ideal. You want whole food proteins as much as possible; shakes should be a post-work out or night time supplement. \n\nYou likely won't gain much muscle on your current plan, especially given your extremely low carb intake, but you shouldn't loose much either. 180g protein at your build should be enough to maintain muscle mass, but you should still drop weight pretty quickly given the low calories. That is very low for your build. As long as you keep the carbs low, and continue the work out plan, it would be more sustainable and healthier to switch out some of your shake calories with other lean proteins, even if it means upping the total calories by 100-200 a day. You should still drop quite fast with that, and its more sustainable than living off protein shakes.",

Its better to cycle your focus every 3 months or so and emphasize one or the other. You can try both and if you're new to fitness you may see a fair amount of others on both fronts but once you stall you'll have to switch things up. If your want to do both at the same time always strength first. Endurance training will sap your strength training. You can look into PHUL programs that are more suited to this type of training. Power, hyper, upper, lower training splits your workouts into one day upper body strength, one day let body strength and then 2 days of upper and lower body hypertrophy or performance training."

They already have to eat some odd 3000-3500 calories, maybe more. In reality, cardio is very, very beneficial to your overall health, stamina, endurance (yes, even for your muscles), and so much more. It's best to incorporate cardio training during workouts, especially since you'll only lose mass if you don't eat enough. And to answer your question finally, they probably just eat a shit ton",

            "It's because cardio doesn't kill gains. In fact, it may help improve gains. It's true that doing cardio will burn a tiny amount if muscle, but it also lowers cortisol and puts the body in a more anabolic state. The lowered reating heartrate relaxes you and helps improve sleep, which means more more gains. You also improve bloodflow, which improves endurance and recovery during resistance training.\n\nThe only way cardio kills gains is if you were a marathon runner, and in no way are you doing enough cardio to get to that point if your goal is building muscle.",
            "Aside from PEDs most of them would probably be much bigger if they prioritized muscle building over performance. I think it goes both ways though, cardio can effect gains and gains can affect cardio. You can't progress on all fronts simultaneously.

In other contexts, you can do cardio every day and not gain much of any muscle (or lose muscle).

On upper body days just my main and the opposing lift for it 2 exercises only. On lower body days Id only squat on Tues and only DL on Fri.  Once I got comfortable with that I started adding a secondary lift each day and eventually I added the accessories. I used to also do bicep and tricep on the upper days but I moved it to my rest day on Wednesday this past year. I've also been adding in shoulders on that day with good results. The reason being I never felt like I was hitting my arms hard enough at the very end of my workout. It felt like junk volume where I wasnt giving enough emphasis and with my tight time limit I was rushing it too much. \n\nAs for the rep and set progression I'll change it every three or so months. When I started I really just hammered the main lifts and opposing lifts. I'd do 5-6 sets on bench and row and might only have time for two sets of db OHP and pullups. On OHP day it was the reverse, I'd do 5-6 sets of OHP and pullups and 2-3 sets of db bench and a row variation. What I feel really helped me was using the concept of a top set. My first set after Warmup would be my top set. Typically I'll work in the 3-5 rep range for 3-4 sets, then drop down and work in a higher rep range for 2-3 sets. If I hit 5 reps in my top set I'll keep the same weight and go for another set, if I don't get 5 reps I'll drop the weight and go for another 5 reps, if I hit 5 reps there I'll keep the same weight and do one more set.

A diet and workout program is not a difficult thing to do on your own.  There's an unfortunate circumstance that leads to this kind of predatory advertising and sales.  Do yourself a favor and arm yourself with knowledge before buying a program. The [fitness wiki](https://thefitness.wiki) is a great start.

The focus should be to learn proper lifting form on as many exercises as you can.  For diet, count your calories and make sure you eat maintenance calories while getting at least 50 g of protein daily.  Both are very simple so focus on learning execution and consistency.  It's not easy but it's worth it.  There is no rush in adapting to a new lifestyle.  You'll want to do it carefully and with technique.

The VIP program provides recipes and weight training videos. The food is based upon very high protein all day long. There is so much food involved every single day....far more than what I ate before VShred. They tell you, you have to eat it all if you want to succeed. It is the food that changes a sluggish metabolism into an active one. What a bunch of garbage. Who has heard of over eating to lose weight?\n\nThe thing is, that the presentation with Vince which is a full one hour video is laced with red flags. One right after another. I wish I was a person who could separate hype and desire, from truth. I do know this, any company that make a viewer watch a one hour presentation is doing so to bait, hook, and pull in the fish. It is this simple. Millions of us fall for this. I did. My suggestion is that, a viewer put on their running shoes and take off in the opposite direction.\n\nNow I am battling to get my money back. This 100% guarantee of money being returned, no questions asked....not true. I have only been in the program two weeks. In this short time my body feels worse. I have an upset stomach all the time. Constipation is now a real thing. I have been following their program like the bible and guess what I got from it....1.5 extra pounds in weight, and in two weeks. At this rate, I will weigh more then when I started.\n\nThis program is seriously flawed. It is not based on real science. There is no such thing as a pill that eats fat away without doing a single thing. Companies like VShred prey on people all in the name of making a sale. They don't really care about the people.

Well, you may get away with it for ten years when you're young but all that accumulated junk food takes effect as you age into your 40s with serious inflammation & lowers your metabolism.\n\nIt's a shame that k6-K12 p.e. class has become optional in U.S. schools. The lack of a mandatory exercise system is making US kids unhealthy by encouraging no exercise and junk food. In the end all you get are expensive medical bills and living obese. 90% of the time it's what you ate when you were a teen that affects you today. I know fat families and sometimes they have one or two kids who defy the odds because they made healthy food choices and lifestyle.\n\nTIP:  If I were you I would not eat a chipotle burrito. Order the burrito salad without the unhealthy flour tortilla. No cheese. Load up on guac and say no to starbucks and breaded chicken sandwiches at Chik Fil-A with more bread. Cut out bread in the am and/or evening. More fibrous foods and no, not just rice or pasta. Eat green beans , spinach, kale, lettuce. In fact, eat black beans and cauliflower rice with some seasoning of garlic, turmeric, and roasted onions and grilled chicken (no skin). Heat a sweet potato for dessert and sprinkle cinnamon on top.

I lost 35lbs in 6 weeks and have kept it off with minimal exercise. \n\nBeing active and working out definitely accelerates results. \n\nMy old roommate was a bigger guy, he doesn\u2019t work out much tho. He sits and works from home on the phone. \n\nTook him a few months longer than me to see results but he also lost around 30lbs.",
            "About 4 months ago, I purchased \"Vshred\" . I did the workouts in my home gym,\" womens fatloss\" was the exact app I started with.\u00a0 I used to be heavily into body building/body shaping. I always loved having muscle and a small waist.\u00a0\nI did the follow along exercises, no equipment, just a yoga matt. It inspired me to also do a little more, use my rowing machine and my eliptical trainer that was collecting dust. Before I started Vshred, a had very large hips, and a flabby waist. I had a hard time walking up stairs with groceries.\u00a0 I could hardly run even.\u00a0 Now, I finished my first round of Vshred, 90 days, and i can jog to the end of the street and back (although jogging hurts my knees, so I dont do much ) i have no problems with the stairs. My shoulders are back instead of looking all frumpy. I lost 20 pounds, and gained muscle. I lost several inches on my waist and hips alone.\u00a0 I am feisty again! My spirit is back! I have energy and I eat right and I no longer worry about diabetes.\u00a0 \u00a0My husband tells me I look great. So my hats off to Vince and his crew. He gave me the ambition to be in shape.\u00a0 I never used a personal trainer with it all. The first 3 months was about\u00a0 $49. On sale. Hell's bells, yes!! It was worth it. I will continue using this app. It got me inspired, and I learned new info I did not know about when i was into going to the gym in the 90's. I went from a size 16 to a size 12. I'm going to keep at it!",
            "Just because you pay for info that you can get yourself, doesn't necessarily make it a scam. From what I've seen and heard, the info is legit. There are good workout & food recommendations as well. The average person is not a 'gym is life' person and won't put the effort into doing extensive research just to lose a couple pounds. That's why people pay personal trainers. They're doing the same thing but we don't consider that a scam. You're basically paying 57 dollars to have the upfront work done for you. You also get the 'community' aspect which can be a big motivator and sense of support for people. From my understanding, the 57 dollars gives you access for life so if you use it once and never again, at least you learned something that you probably weren't going to take the time to learn yourself. It's the program completely unnecessary? Yes. Is it a scam? I would say No.",

Now, having spent $124, I log into my account and more and more videos!  I listened to another one and again it ended with promoting a supplement.  I searched the website for the exercise video I thought we would automatically get and all I see are videos that need to be purchased for $47 or $57 dollars. Right away emails are sent and they want you to buy more items.  I immediately knew I wanted out!  I decided to stop and look up reviews online and waalaa here I a with many more that feel the same way.  Congrats to those that paid the money and it works for you but I decided to get out ASAP.  I already asked for a refund and they said it should come in 5 days.",
            "It's worth every penny, it's a bargain. A one time payment of $55 for a rockin' bod? How can you beat that? Quit exercising, that's not how you lose weight, running just burns calories, usually in the form of carbs in the bloodstream that are then replaced with the very next meal you eat as fat. The key to losing weight is not keto, paleo, carnivore, it's not vegan and it's definitely not super intense exercises. That aint how you lose weight.",

As a bartender in Miami even tho I was a college ball player I find it almost impossible to follow anyone\u2019s routine cause of my hours worked. But this looks reasonable.

            "NOOOOO!!! It is so over the top. The program is completely complicated and not sustainable, and once you purchase, you will be INUNDATED with messaging and ads to upsell. I bought the base program - I figured what the heck, it was around $55. I don't have much weight to lose; I want to clean up my diet, lose 15-20lbs, and get into a better routine for working out. The plan uses metabolic confusion, but the app and website are loaded with stuff that isn't under the base plan. You have do your own calculations for macros and your own meal plan with the basic plan. Once you try to craft a meal plan, it is so ridiculous the amount of ingredients and prep needed. Plus, you are expected to cook every meal, every day. This is just not doable for most people. On top of the nutrition part, you have limited access to their workouts, which are nothing new or exciting (think HIIT workouts you can get for free on Youtube or elsewhere). There is a Facebook group that I joined, and most people there are affiliated with the program, so they do daily pep talks and workouts. Those are fine, but not everyone can do a 9:00am workout or live stream chat. A lot of people in the group have asked for more simple and sustainable recipes/meal plans, but often, the answer is that you need to upgrade to the 1 on 1 plan. I am pretty sure they sell your information to their partners also. Lastly, I did their metabolic assessment, and yet I keep getting emails that are deceiving... \"I see you missed our appointment...\" and then the message says I need to take the metabolic assessment test that I already took. All in all, the program has potential, and I do like the science and design of what it is intended to be... It just fails at focussing on the clients rather than the money making. Someone needs to come in and streamline the program, update the app, raise the price a little to give full access ($79 would be more reasonable for a tailored meal plan/recipes, access to all workout, etc)... Upgrades could be for 1 on 1 coaching, and other extras.",

I only purchased what i thought was a 90 day meal plan that comes with an email coach. It's not 90 days. The meal plan was 7 days and she did customize it around my likes, dislikes, and allergies. But you either repeat the same plan weekly (I did order a carb cycling meal plan) or you have to figure out what to substitute to stay within your macros. She did offer to send me alternative meals as I mentioned several were on the spicy side. Today, my email told me the coach is only for 30 days, not 90. For $47/mo. more I could continue having a coach. For $99/mo I could get that plus a customized exercise plan.  Emails are always flooding your inbox for weekly \"send us your $s\" for supplements, access to special events, join the pyramid and become a coach, etc. So, I'm not mad I tried it, it gave this beginner enough tips and info to customize my own meal and exercise routine.

            "I listened to his repetitive, time wasting spheel knowing what it was. Whenever he did make a claim, it was true. He is right that overly focusing on cardio and starving yourself can stall weight loss and plateaus. He is correct that a lot of fad diets result in weight gained back.\n\nSome of those diets have other unmentioned purposes however, like anti inflammation, anti seizure, blood sugar stabilization, neurogenesis and so forth. His points about grehlin and leptin not caring if \"you look hot\" were on point. It seems as though he knows the science and is a pretty bright guy. The only issue is that information is out there in droves and you don't need his program, he isn't safeguarding some secret.\n\nMy take away is the macros it calculated looked solid, the carbs should generally be low glycemic index and resistance training will help you lose weight and preserve more muscle than 180bpm worth of treadmill for an hour daily.\n\nI personally would not sign up. Go download a pdf of the 4-hour body instead, or something, and use it for basic understanding nutrition and resistance training.\n\nexperience: shredded on only 3 days heavy lifting and 2 days yoga, 20 minutes of cardio only (stairs) after the lifts (followed by quick carbs and protein) per week.

They start by saying you don't burn fat, only calories by running, and they are replaced the next meal \ud83e\udd26 everytime i see this i want to reach through the screen and slap him. You burn fat by being in a calorie deficit and running is a great way to get there. No matter what you burn you will replinish with your next meal, the key is being in a daily deficit. He's also eating donuts in his ads, it's very bad to consume sugar when trying for weight loss. Not only does excess sugar get stored as fat, it jacks your insulin levels way up more than any other food, and when insulin is spiked, your body cannot start any fat burning process. This is the worst guy of all time, stay far far away from him.",

I did not buy the supplements. I made my own protein shakes and counted calories on a different app. Wieghed myself and measured myself to keep on track as they asked.\u00a0\nI will tell you that being in the program that you have access to a Facebook page with thousands of people like you going through the same thing and it is very motivational. I struggled with cardio, used a treadmill and counted calories on my own for 3 months prior to the program and did not lose 1 lbs not 1 lb.\u00a0 all that did is frustrate me and made me quit. I have tried other workout plans and could never lose any weight. I do not know what happened with other people that they did not like vshred but I would say you don't have to buy their bulk up extra programs or protein supplements just use the Hitt videos and start with a nutritionist food program for two months to start kick off. Then you can do on your own.\u00a0\nI have starved myself, ate different foods, walked everyday, drank 64 oz of water a day and not lost 1 lb before. Somehow this vshred worked, maybe a fluke but I am going to start up again after taken a break for 1 year due to some other personal issues I had. Hope to have the same results so I can get healthy again.\u00a0",

I dealt with his long-winded intro by turning down the volume, but his main points, once he gets to them, are quite sensible.\r  \n\r  \nPoint #2, carb rotation, makes sense. It's more practical than Atkins, which I dropped after two years. It's not about totally ditching carbs, just reducing them on some days, making it a good fit for more people than strict paleo.\r  \n\r  \nAnd point #3 is solid: cardio isn't just endless treadmill hours. You could, but why? He's all for HIIT - 15 min, three times a week, akin to REHIT (Reduced High-Intensity Training), and there's research to back this up, like the AI bike Carol.\r  \n\r  \nSo, spending $57 to learn about REHIT and carb rotation is better than wasting it on junk food. His marketing is intense, but it's educational compared to what the junk food industry spends. Sure, this info is available for free, but if it's not being sought out or learned, that's where he fills the gap.",

He also doesn't say you don't need to cut carbs he says you don't need to CUT OUT carbs meaning stopping carbs all together. He says you just need to eat the right ones and at the right time. It's like any diet out there people hear what they want to and then get mad when its not what they heard.....",
            "Ok, but everything he says is true. It's just not a secret like he claims. Carbs regulate body fat when other sources of fat are not consumed in large quantities, like sugar and saturated fat. You also definitely do not need cardio to lose weight. That doesn't even make sense. Cardio was never a fat losing method. Cardio is mainly for organ health. Losing fat is about what goes into our bodies, and utilizing energy to burn through that food. And cardio burns energy very slowly compared to an intense 20 minute strength session. This is his \"secret\". It's a highly intense 20 minute workout 7bdays a week that most of you couldn't do anyways.",

The program itself has some great points, but it is so difficult and not sustainable. Who can cook every meal, every day with new ingredients? Most us need some convenience foods, bulk cooking, eating out tactics, and limited ingredients/less expense. I would've rather paid a little more for tailored meal plans and recipes that fit with a busier lifestyle. I'm all for HIIT workouts, but I'm also 55 and most of the workouts just don't work for me - I can't do lunges and jumps due to bad knees, for example. The app and website are terrible.

He said \"money back guarantee,\" so I figured why not.  That was during the pandemic.  I switched out my shirts to athletic fit and bought new jeans for my smaller waist.  Then I tried the version in the gym.  I was less strict on the diet and supplements, now that I think about it, the HITT too (I started doing some mounting biking instead of running hills).  My progress was a bit slower.  I wanted to get bigger and cut.  That sort of worked.  My 6 pack is a little less defined than I'd like it to be, so I'm looking at ways to maximize that, but my strength is okay.  It seams easier to work on getting big and then get cut.  So I'm doing that now.  My legs are too big for my jeans (quad and calf muscle) and my weight is up while I've been getting bigger, so with summer coming it is time to get ripped again--guess I'll add in more HITT.  I came here to see what people thought of the supplements, but with all this negativity on the program, maybe having a real person mention that it worked for them would be useful.

Maybe you could argue the yoga or stretching ones aren\u2019t as brutal but these are far from what Vshred seems to promise is required, as they say \u201ceasy\u201d, which P90X definitely is not.\n\nHaving said that P90X definitely works, I did 2 rounds back to back to get in shape for my wedding, and I\u2019ve never been more fit in my entire life.

Who has time or money for all of that? You have limited access to workouts also, and I can't do half the HIIT moves due to bad knees/back.

Or could be a good coach. You don't know who you are getting. It would be like getting a fitness coach from someone who said they were on the biggest looser show.

I have a lot of physical problems especially in my spine. Your body will love slow movement and full body work outs for about 30 minutes a few times a week to start. Don\u2019t underestimate the impact of being kind to your body and doing low stress work outs. Look into Leslie Sansone. She has great walk fit w/o with HIIT sessions. She has an app too. I actually saw the vshred video this morning and realized I can do this on my own. I suggest you eat healthy foods that make you happy and begin something soft for your body and increase as your strength increases. That\u2019s what I do. If you put health first over weight loss you will have better success overtime. Begin where you\u2019re comfortable and learn about nutrition and what YOU respond to best. Happiness is important for low stress to get healthy results.",

Although, I can see how it could work for some people.    \n- The stretching was something I already from martial arts so didn't need it.   \n- The yoga and pilates poses were very new and some poses do target stubborn love handle fat and your upper trunk. Some hurt my shoulder (which I need for tennis) so I do not do yoga beyond Warrior 3 poses or chin-ups anymore.  \nI have trimmed down the original P90X to 20-30 min/day and just 3-4 days a week (memorized them all) & incorporated bits of some into another.  Plus, it's mainly because I'll be on the courts on the weekends and/or another day during the week.  I  \nP90X helped me lose stubborn fat in the chest, love handles and do more body weight exercises that focus on the core. There's many advanced tennis drills and strengthening off-court that overlap with P90X (planks, burpees, arm curls, lunges, turn lift dumbbells and place above) so I just took what I was missing.   \n- Sprints are great for improving your speed and your metabolism to burn fat.   \nYes, I agree there seems to always be upsells with all of them.\n\nI believe more emphasis needs to be put on riding a bike (stationary or mountain) to strengthen your quads which helps your knees and longevity.

I was very busy decided to look at it later, but last week since I decided let me make use of the money I spent, I started looking for some documentations, some pictures, some nutrition plan in my emails, I find nothing. There is not even a website link for the money I paid (well there is for like $10 a month extra) I get a lot of emails that sound very very very promising and exactly what I need, but then when I click on any of them, it is again a very long long infomercial video which I cannot fast forward or get to the end so I can listen to the last 5 minutes. That dangling carrot keeps moving further and further out of reach for me.\n\nThen I clicked on one of the emails which asks me to get a free free metabolic assessment of myself explained to me by a coach. Lucky me, I like the word free so I agreed to meet this coach.\n\nIt was a 30 mins but he wasn't in a hurry to let me go even after 1 hour. He tried to sell me another program, where I meet with another coach who will design a plan for my specific metabolic needs I asked him the cost for 6 months, he said $6K but he was willing to give it to me for a 50% discount. He keeps asking me what information do I need to make a decision (not very different from buying a car). So at this point I paid $134 to have this meeting with somebody who is trying to sell me the real product. \n\nHowever, I kept asking him I already paid $134 and what do I get for that? and he says he doesn't have my purchases in front of him,to answer that question. After the meeting, I'm looking and looking for some plan (even if it is not customized to my needs) so I can follow it? even if it is a lesser plan? I don't have it, I was at least expecting a PDF or something in my email. \n\nI don't know about others, but I will cut my losses right here ($134) and just because I'm losing that money I will be listening more to Eric Berg, and Jason Fung, and Dr. Sten Ekberg videos, there are a lot of fantastic videos there and they are not infomercials.",

Repeat the intense cardio for another 10 seconds.\n5. Conclude with a 3-minute cool-down.\n\nAs you progress, you can gradually increase the duration of steps 2 and 4 from 10 seconds to 15, then 20 seconds.\n\nThe Carol AI bike enhances this process by using artificial intelligence to adjust the pedaling intensity based on your fitness level, ensuring you're always working at your peak capacity within your target heart zone.

They can: \n\n\\- help to burn calories (cardio is great at this, especially at intensities that are easy enough you can do longer workouts)\n\n\\- help to build muscle (lifting is great at this, calisthenics *can* be good at it depending on what you do)\n\nUltimately whether you lose fat depends on how much you're eating compared to how much you burn. Having more muscle mass helps, but it takes a long time to build enough muscle to make a big difference in your daily calorie burn. \n\nSo can you lose weight effectively while doing cardio? Yep, for sure. Can you lose weight effectively while doing calisthenics? Yes, also a good idea. You can even do both.

The big rocks are nutrient dense foods, quality rest and progressive overload\u2014this is where the majority of your progress will come from.\n\nLook, if you have the funds after all that, by all means, try some supplements. I\u2019d steer clear of preworkout and fat burners.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to start somewhere, prepare a quality intra workout drink that\u2019ll fuel your sessions. Load it with creatine (mono), EAAs, sodium/potassium (electrolyte balance) and dextrose (carbs). That\u2019ll give your workout the most bang for buck.",
            "Protein shake and creatine. Prices are going nuts though but both are still affordable. Getting your protein from natural sources will always be better but never as convenient. Vegetable or animal protein sources just have more nutrients.\n\nBut, hitting 100 g of protein per day is so much easier and less expensive with protein shakes. There are so many flavours available so it\u2019s easy to find one that you like. Also modifying the flavour of a shake by adding in a tbsp of cinnamon or cocoa powder is very easy and inexpensive cash and calorie wise."

The reason for that was, who expects it, but in reality I was eating way to less foot that my body required.\n\nIf you are skinny your body has probably a very fast metabolism and in order to counter that and actually gain body mass you have to eat. I managed to gain body mass when I started to insert healthy high calorie food into my diet + counting macros. My list:\n\n* Peanut butter,\n* Milk\n* **Oats**\n* Rice\n* Nuts\n* Whole grain bread\n* Avocados\n* **Cheese**\n* Fat yogurt\n\nWhat was a real game changer for me was to drink smoothies made out of milk, blended oats, peanut butter and some fruits. This is an easy way to get a extra 1000cal into your diet. Check out some youtube videos like this one : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a\\_4iLDRZRU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a_4iLDRZRU)\n\nIn regards to your workout plan I am sorry for your lung issues and do not really want to give you any detailed advice since I am not a doctor.\n\nBut I can clarify some point:\n\n* You don't need to lift super heavy to make gains\n* Maybe you could do your weight training first and then do some heavy cardio (Maybe 3 times a week weight training + cardio and 2 separate cardio sessions )\n\nrecommend you my website [fitbuild.app](https://fitbuild.app) (only for desktop). It helps you create your own personalized workout plan.\n\nI hope my answer helps you.\n\nKind regards\n\nTobi",

Top your food with dried fruit, chopped nuts or seeds, honey, bacon bits, cheeses, mayonnaise, and salad dressings.\n-\tPrepare your food with extra virgin olive oil or coconut oil to add calories.

Commercial supplements such as meal replacement bars are also options.\n\nThis will be a good place to start with your diet.

So technically you\u2019re burning a higher *percentage* of fat in low intensity exercise than in high intensity exercise. This doesn\u2019t actually matter, though, because your body is always burning and storing fat. What matters is how many total calories you ended up burning at the end of the day. I like to think of burning fat vs burning carbs as like whether you spend cash from your wallet or use a debit card to pull from your bank account.

This will prevent injuries.   \n\n\nThe other key is to go below the weight/volume that is going to make you sore (DOMS), so that you can train regularly. Most people think being sore is a sign of muscle growth, and it does correlate, but because it causes you to miss workouts and sets, in the end its going to slow you down and make it more likely that you injure yourself.  \n\n\nWhat I do after a hiatus is to do like 60% of what I think I can do the first time I do a muscle group, then the second time, say 3 days later, I do 70% of what I think I can do, then 80% then 90% and 100%. So by the time I'm at 100%, I'm on my 5th day and 3rd week of doing that particular lift. This mostly pertains to the lifts that make someone sore, or lifts that are really complex moments where you might get injured (deadlift, squat, cleans, etc). The other reason for this is that your body's ability to recruit all the stabilizer muscles is probably poor, so by doing sets at lower weight/volume allows you to learn to do proper form while its much easier preventing injury."

            "You missed time that you will never get back.  That's true for everyone and that is why its important to stay the course and keep working towards your goals.  Wasted potential is too harsh of way to look at it.  17 to 21 is a special time due to hormonal advantages but 21 to 25 is just as advantageous.  Men typically see a decline in testosterone production from the age of 30 onwards.\n\nYou've worked hard, had some fantastic results, and experienced a few setbacks.  You know you want to continue on.  It's totally possible for you to reach your goals as long as you keep working hard and maintain a positive attitude towards your hard work.  It's time to have gratitude for the lessons learned so far, plan, recalibrate, and move on to the next challenges.\n\nThe trickiest part of this lifestyle is managing your mental health. It has to compliment your physical health. The mind is more powerful than you can imagine.  It can absolutely be detrimental if you let your emotions make the decisions for you.  To work hard enough to reach your goals you have to love yourself enough to make it worth it.  If you don't love yourself enough the urge to quit can become a difficult thought to resist.  Disciplining your emotions with positive self talk, positive affirmations, robust self care habits, etc. are just a few ways to start developing your self esteem.\n\nA more fundamental approach to your attitude is to have more gratitude for what you have right now. I am so greatful to even have the opportunity to improve my health through diet and exercise.  There are many that aren't as fortunate due to circumstances beyond their control.",

Go super light the first day to the point you don't get DOMS or get very little. \n\n2. DOMS is made far worse by the parts of the movement where the muscle is under heavy load AND stretched, so minimize this for the first couple times. For example, I won't go as far down on my squats for the first 3 sessions back because this is the maximum stretch for the muscle and squats make me very sore. Then I'll start improving my squat range of motion once I no longer get DOMS from squating. \n\n3. Foam rolling and supplements such as Curcumin, Branched-Chain Amino Acids, Tart Cherry Juice, Fish Oil, Taurine, Vitamin C, and Beet Root have all been shown to help DOMS per [Examine.com](https://Examine.com) and other sources, but the effect sizes are tiny.

It\u2019s better than nothing but it\u2019s far from optimal. \n\nIf there is one thing we know about hypertrophy training, it\u2019s that high mechanical tension at a muscle\u2019s greatest length is very hypertrophic. \n\nBands are less than optimal because band tension is increased as a muscle performs concentric contraction (shortens) and bands lose tension as a muscle performs eccentric contraction (lengthens).",

            "If the bands provide necessary tension at the beginning of the movement (which is also the end of the movement), then that would definitely be a step in the right direction. This is also assuming that the tension at the beginning doesn\u2019t severely limit full ROM as the bands go through further tension and/or it doesn\u2019t impair how many reps you can do (i.e. <5 = probably not great).\n\nThe main issue then, would become exercise selection.",
            "Depends. Time under tension is semi-important but can be close to useless in some contexts. It needs to be paired with a notable mechanical stimulus for it to be important.\n\nUsing the band as an example, as the band loses tension, the muscle is being exposed to less resistance, which means the mechanical stimulus is diminishing. So it would depend at which joint angle(s) is/are being slowed because the angle will directly correlate with the band tension.\n\nAnother example of TUT potentially being useless is during bicep curls with a pencil. You can provide a constant tension for 5 minutes and not accomplish anything because the mechanical load was insufficient.\n\nHence the term mechanical tension. TUT is just a component of mechanical tension and only matters when a significant load or resistance is present"

Keep your eyes directly forward, which cues your chest upward.  \n3) You need to engage lats and keep your shoulders down while you are lifting.  \n\n\nYou should also be doing a lot of core, esp. core where you have to keep your inner abs hard. This is hard to describe, but your inner abs need to push out in order to keep the core stable while you deadlift. Its possible you are already doing this - can't tell from a video, but its important and can be trained by doing like deadbugs and other core exercises that emphasize this.",

I would say aim for 1 gram of protein per lb of body weight (or in a range of 0.8 - 1.2 g's, it's a hotly debated topic but I aim for 1g to keep it simple). After that is covered work on being in a slight calorie deficit, not much but 500 calories less is a good place to start. \n\nAfter that hit the gym but focus on lifting heavy with compound lifts. I like sticking to the big 4 of: bench, deadlift, squat, and military press. \nObviously you can add in others and you want to add in some cardio, especially as heart health is a priority for you, but you can get pretty far with fixing your skinny fat concerns with just those compound lifts.\n\nI'm regards to your hernia though, I can't comment on that as I'm not a professional and I haven't dealt with that personally, so it might be worth working with a trainer, at least at the start, to find a workout program that gets around that obstacle. \n\n\nShits hard but starting is the hardest part.",

Digesting large amounts of nutrient dense foods is key to a healthy lifestyle.  If your digestion is weak or if you are bloated/constipated that just won't happen.  Stay hydrated to avoid that but sometimes it is not that simple.",
            "So from a science based perspective, workouts only matter in a very specific way for you. The more you lift and the harder you lift (intensity), then the more muscle you will retain as you lose weight. I don't want to get into the details, but cardio doesn't really matter (unless you are out of breath while lifting).  \n\n\nThe much more complicated thing is diet. You need to track you calories and basically aim to lose .5KG per week. There are calculators online to help you estimate how many calories you should be eating, then weigh yourself everyday and once a week alter your calories if you are losing too much or too little.. Getting up to .5g protein per kg will also help you lose less muscle - this is especially key for you since you are my age and no longer rely on hormones as much for muscle creation.  \n\n\nThe goal here is to lose .5kg per week and have 80% of it be fat rather than muscle. Newbie lifters (people who haven't lifted in a while can get 6-12 months of 100% fat loss often. .5kg per week can leave you pretty tired, although everytime you go through a cut it gets easier. Also, you can lose fat more slowly if you want, but I wouldn't lose it too much faster unless you are a newbie lifter, in which case you can sometimes lose .75kg or even 1kg per week.  \n\n\nCutting processed foods also helps you because they cause you to overeat in the medium term by messing with your satiety signaling to your brain.",

It might be you need to deload every 4 weeks until you are more used to the workout.  \n\n\nIts unlikely to be a calorie issue if you aren't losing weight, although eating more (lean bulk) might help address certain issues. Dropping calories will def make it worse, but almost all people who are cutting lots of calories are constantly dealing with low energy and are on edge of overtraining.  \n\n\nOvertraining is generally not a problem with your amount of lifting (assuming 1 hr per workout with high intensity), but it could be if you are just getting used to it. The general first solution is too fix your eating/sleeping/stress/alcohol. The second step would be to do a deload week when you need to do one. Another way to deal with it is to reduce the total intensity - if you are aiming at having low body fat, then usually people dump the cardio or change it to simply walking, even though cardio contributes a lot to overall health."

            "Congrats on that! The general rule of thumb in my opinion is that you cut at least until you hit a look that you want to keep, so for me, I'd probably cut until I was 15% body fat. Then slow bulk up to say 17% body fat and then cut again. You can use RFM (Real Fat Mass) to get an estimate on that.\n\nHowever, I would say that the bigger thing you MIGHT need to do is lift more. Were you lifting 4x per week during the year? I feel like if you had been, you'd probably have enough muscle at this point that you'd be close to 15% body fat. It's also possible you weren't eating enough protein, because that can also cause body composition issues.  \n\n\nIf you are super tired of cutting, then I would pause to recomp and get your lifting and nutrition in order. In most of the scientific experiments where participants lost a ton of weight, there was a pretty big downregulation of metalbolism (ie the number of calories required to maintain their weight dropped below where it should be). If you recomp at maintenance calories, your body will start healing from that, but it will likely take months to fully heal. Also people who took deficit breaks kept the weight off much longer on average because the diet break teaches you how to eat at maintenance calories.  \n\n\nThe most important thing is just that you don't put it back on, and I think bulking is a mistake for that reason. People start bulking and their discipline goes down the tube. Plus if you still have high body fat, you should still be able to lose fat AND gain muscle at the same time, especially if you haven't been lifting that much, which means that recomp or cutting are your best bets.  \n\n\nIf you are cutting correctly, more than 80% of what you lose should be fat and less than 20% should be muscle. It's worth measuring body fat percentage to see if you are achieving this."

The belt is going to let you get away with some stuff that you might not want to get away with, for example not engaging the core properly, so I'd at least do some of my work without a weight belt.\n\nThis guy is a physical therapist that is pretty good about everything form in lifting, and he has a video specifically on proper use of weight lifting belts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=671OihFu9eg"

The best way to do it is to track your weight for 2 weeks and track how many calories you are eating.

The cut will probably be overly large and you'll end up losing a lot of the gains too. \n\nBody recomp with a very slow cut will make you look more normal during the process but will obviously take longer. \n\nMy advice is cut hard if you're willing to get skinny, otherwise do a body recomp.",

The recomp will let you take extra advantage of your newbie gains since you are not lifting regularly. But in general, assuming you are lifting regularly, you should cut if you are above 15%-20% body fat, then bulk back up to 15-20%.   \n\n\nAdditionally, this is not personal, but your bulking went off the track a bit last time. You gained about 20 lbs in 5 months, so 1 lb per week. This is the right amount of weight gain, but you didn't get the ratio of muscle/fat gain that you wanted. Either you weren't lifting 4+ hours per week with intensity, or you weren't eating enough protein or you were eating processed foods and overeating, then under-eating. If you can't commit to 4+ hours of hard lifting per week and great nutrition, then aim for less weight gain per week. Same applies to cutting. If you don't lift a lot and eat right you will waste all your muscle cutting and be in a worse spot. Imagine that you are 100kg and 20% body fat. You then gain 10kg, but its 60% muscle and 40% fat because you didn't do it right. You are now 110K at 21.6% body fat. Then you cut 10K and you lose 60% fat and 40% muscle because you don't do it right. You've just done all that work to get to 18.2% body fat. If you did it again, but you were precise and gained 80% muscle and 20% fat (then lost the reverse), you would end up at 14.5% body fat over the same amount of time. In other words, being a little better pays huge dividends for bulking/cutting.  \n\n\n1 lb per week is the right amount if you are doing everything correctly, and if you are, you should end up gaining 70-90% muscles and 10-30% fat (same in reverse for cutting). If you aren't hitting in this range then thats the primary thing to fix.\n\nSo for example, I also started up lifting again recently and I was at like 20% body fat so I recomped for a month and then cut for 3 months and lost 10lbs. 8 of those lbs were fat and 2 were muscle and I was doing most things right. I think I could have done 9 and 1 if I had been even more exact with things. This meant I went from 184 lbs and 20% body fat to 174 with 16.5%, so visible abs but not super cut. I plan to do that again only better/faster in order to get to 164 with 12.6% body fat. Then I'll consider a slow bulk or recomp if I don't mind the lower weight.",

Soreness is a terrible indicator of progress. In fact, optimally you really don't want to be too sore, at least not so sore that you miss a workout.   \n\n\nProgressive Overload to ensure you are getting to failure:  \n\\-Write down what you are doing for an excercise: For example 3 sets of 10 reps for bench press at 120 lbs.  \n\\-If you complete all 3 sets of 10 with good form, then the next time you do it, you make it 3 sets of 10 reps at 125 lbs (the minimum amount you can increase it). Up your weight EVERY time you complete all sets.  \n\\-if you complete it again, you keep adding weight.  \n\\-If you can't complete all 3 sets of 10, then you keep the weight the same until you can complete it. Then move up weight. \n\nNOTE: use a spotter on your last set if you don't think you will get all the reps... this ensures that you are actually \"going to failure\" or at least really close. It also provides social pressure because typically I'll say \"I'm going for 8\" and then I really want to hit it in front of the person.\n\nAs long as you are doing this, you will be totally fine. The people who aren't going intense enough in the gym typically fall into two camps.\n\n1) some people take super long rest periods and kind of mess around. These people should work out with someone who knows what they are doing in order to see what real intensity is, because they are sometimes getting half as many total sets each workout so they are getting probably about 60% as much muscle growth out of it. For comparison, I get about 30 sets completed in 60 minutes (45 min if i'm going fast). My personal trainer friend does 30 sets in 45 min unless he is lifting super heavy.\n\n2) Some people don't don't actually go to failure either because they don't increase their weights every time they complete all sets, or because they really could have done a couple more reps, but are too lazy. This is harder to distinguish from the outside, but use a spotter if you don't know if you are going to failure and then you will physically fail on the last rep. The fact is that most of your gains are made on the last couple reps before failure, so if you go say 3 reps short each time it will really slow down improvement. As you get more experienced, you'll be able to know exactly which rep you are going to fail on, and you can skip that final half rep / failure rep if you want. Its unclear scientifically how much the final half rep helps you, plus there are injury risks if you don't have a spotter/experience.",

Progressive overload is increasing the numbers in the next session if you hit them in the previous.\n\nWorkouts get a bit complicated, but if you are doing the same stuff everyday, then lift every other day. More advanced lifters have say 2 workouts, A and B, and then do A1 then B1, then rest/cardio day, then A2, then B2 then rest/cardio day. Repeat. A1 and A2 hit the similar muscle groups, but in different ways. The goal of all of this it to give a muscle group time too recover (ideally 2-3 days) before hitting it again. This is a simplification, but you should just grab a good workout from the internet, not design your own.",
            "Ahh no you're good. If you get to a point where you can't pull the weight down anymore (or whatever the lift is), you have trained \"to failure.\" It's literally impossible to do anything more than that. \n\nSo, you did it! You did a workout. All you have to do now is keep doing it. I strongly recommend using one of the beginner-friendly programs from [here](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/). You just follow the instructions, and if you did everything you were supposed to for the day, you know you pushed hard enough and you know you hit all your muscle groups. \n\nThat's all there is to it. Put in the work, and results will follow. \n\nPS. Don't worry about whether you're getting sore. The quote you give below says that you need to \"exhaust your muscles\" which isn't exactly true, but you are clearly exhausting your muscles if you go to failure! So you don't need soreness to tell you whether you're doing it or not. You know that you're doing it. \n\nKeep on keeping on, man. Three months from now you're going to feel like a totally different person.",

Extending the leg back under load places the glutes and hamstrings at the end of their range of motion, and on top of that, requires them to contract while at the end of the ROM. Most people don't do that, so I'm guessing your body is unfamiliar with that movement. At the same time, the quadruplex involves extending the opposite arm forward. Again, many people I've seen do this don't have the overhead mobility to fully extend the arm up, so they  compensate by raising the shoulder and extending the spine, tensing the entire posterior chain. This could also cause you to over-contract the glutes unconsciously as you try to hold the position. The body is trying everything it can to do what you think will help."

Supplementing probiotics, prebiotics, ginger root tablets, and ground flax seed seem to work for many people. Try things until things work for you. Have you talked to your trainer about this? Can they refer you to a dietitian or nutritionist?"

If you're able to train with barbells, that would make it easier to get a heavier workout in. \n\nYou can make gains on 3 days a week but it helps if those days are full body instead of a split. If Frankoman is working for you, stick with it, but if you're not seeing the results you want, it may be time to pick something else. \n\nYou can take creatine if you want. \n\n10 pounds down in 2 months sounds like good progress. I'd stick with the same plan if you want to continue losing weight. End the cut when you're either (1) bored of dieting, or (2) feel like you don't want to get any smaller (whichever comes first). \n\nYou can get a few different options for lifting programs, plus advice on fat loss, muscle gain, and fitness in general, at the [fitness wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/guided-tour/).",

If I were to suggest three pieces of equipment it would be a yoga mat, a pull-up bar, and a 35 lb kettlebell. Love kettle bell swings as they seem to benefit all other lifts. \n\nIn my opinion, you absolutely should supplement creatine. It\u2019s proven to be safe and effective. It\u2019s relatively inexpensive and easy to acquire. I read somewhere that it increases performance by 1 - 5% per workout. Add those gains up over a year of working out and it makes a significant difference.\n\n1800 calories seems about right. Your base line, TDE, is the total number of calories you need in a day. I\u2019m 39 and only moderately active. My TDE is 1900 so cutting 100 calories would be perfect for me. What is your TDE? You can google it and calculate it online for free.

            "Instructor here!\n\nI think you're getting confused as to what compound and isolation means. \n\nCompound exercises are movements which target multiple muscle groups. \n\nIsolation movements are exercises that target single muscle groups. \n\nThese do not refer to whole workouts, but singular exercises.\n\nThe workout you label an \"isolation\" workout, is a type of routine that most call a \"bro split.\" This is where you focus on one muscle group each day. So as you say, you may do chest one day, back the next, then legs, arms, etc. This is the routine that classic bodybuilders used such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrignou.\n\nThe movements you would use on each wouldn't necessarily use purely isolation movements and honestly, I'd challenge you to produce a functioning workout that uses only isolation movements. \n\nBro splits would still use compound movements on each day to target each muscle group. Some muscle groups will be hit twice a week, such as the triceps, shoulders and biceps. The large muscle groups like the chest and back, not so much. \n\nWhen you refer to compound workouts, I have a strong suspicion that you're referring to push pull splits. \n\nPush pull splits, will engage two muscle groups per training session and as you say, allow you to train the same muscle groups twice a week. \n\nThe truth is, there is no such thing as a better workout split as everyone's body is different. One workout split that may work for you, may not work for another person. Scientifically, it has been shown that generally, push pull produces results in a shorter period of time in comparison to a bro split, but results will eventually level out and continue to produce results at the same rate as the bro split. \n\nThe conclusion is, either works for stimulating muscles and really, it comes down to what you would personally prefer. I've tried both and for myself, I found both work equally as well. I got decent results from both. But again, it comes down to your body and what works best for you.\n\nThere are other factors along side results too, like fun and time. Bro splits usually cater to those who have more time for the gym and find it more enjoyable to focus on one muscle group each workout. Push pull splits cater to those who have less time for the gym but like more variety in their weeks. (Honestly, arguments could be made for the same points either side.)"

Newbies usually suffer with DOMS for quite a while (even up to a week) because their muscles aren't adapted to the stress they're put under when lifting. The lactic acid threshold isn't as high either, so that would also provide another factor for extended DOMS. So really, if this is what it is, then that's, fine just give your legs time to heal. \n\nHowever, if you think something is seriously wrong though, then see your doctor, don't go looking on Reddit for advice Lmao"

            "Certified PT, Nutrionist, and Online Coach here!  \"Belly fat\" or a rounder midsection can be caused by many things: for instance, two different kinds of fat we're dealing with in the midsection: subcutaneous and visceral fat.  There's also a lot to do with posture in lifting your chest so you're standing tall which helps that area. Diet and food intolerance can lead to bloating and other genetic things could also be factors just to name a few. Without knowing more details its hard to know for sure.",

            "Instructor here!\n\nYou already have a gym, you carry it around everywhere you go. \"What gym?\" You might be asking. Well, that would be your body. \n\nWhen getting into exercise, it's always best to start with bodyweight and leave resistance training until at least 4-6 weeks down the line. (you may possibly have the money for a gym then too, depending on your situation.)\n\nSo to begin, full body, bodyweight cardio would give you a perfect starting point and, wow, there's so much you could do. \n\nHonestly, I'd suggest going on YouTube and picking out a 25 - 30 minute cardio routine to complete and just do that 2-3 days a week to begin. During this time, work on getting the diet in order too. If you want some advice on the nutrition side of things feel free to say so and I'll help you with that too. \n\nA great channel I always recommend btw, is fitness blender. They have perfectly structured workouts that will get you going. Here's a couple that I've referred to clients who have been in similar situations to you:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/uNrqrk2xcAo\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fyzveWI25aI\n\nAll the best my man.

            "I started lifting cleaner bottles because I was brand new to it and wanted to start before I could buy anything. They were 1.5lbs/.68kg and worked wonders to get me started. Eventually I bought some heavier dumbbells. Another tip I got from Chalene Johnson(Beachbody) was that you can make any exercise you do harder if you go slow and focus your brain on it. For example...act like whatever you're lifting is 100lbs/45.3kg and it will feel like its 100lbs/43.5kg. My personal favorite is flat on back skullcrushers that I do super duper slow. I always feel a hella burn.",

If anyone is willing to answer me it would be a big help as I need to decide what to study for next year once out of school and I just want to know from the personal trainers if you think it is worth it to do personal training as a main source of income or is it not high paying enough as well as how fo you get paid. Is it per client per month or a base salary and what hours do you work. What are the best and worst parts of being a personal trainer what would you have to do to be able to comfortably sustain yourself and others on your income as a trainer.",

            "Greetings. I've been a trainer and instructor for 3 years now and I believe I can give you an account of this profession. \n\nPersonal training is more of a morally rewarding line of work than it is monetary. While it is certainly possible to make a decent living, it's more about changing people's lives. Taking people who see themselves as unhealthy and out of shape, working with them for months, forming relationships with your clients and seeing them transform themselves into new and improved versions of their old selves. It is fantastic. You really see people light up over time and reach their true potentials. \n\nIt is very competitive though and most states are riddled with trainers who will all have varying rates and specialties, so it's your job to effectively research your area and market yourself properly. Failure to do so will result in a poor client base. \n\nIf this is something you want to do, I'd suggest studying nutrition as well as personal training. Having a degree in nutrition will give you a huge advantage over the majority of trainers out there. (A standard personal trainer cannot prescribe diets, they can only prescribe exercise. Being qualified in both, means you can prescribe both. You will be more desired and be able to charge slightly more than other trainers in your area.) \n\nIn terms of how you charge, well that's down to you. The most commonly chosen business model, includes monthly subscriptions. These range between $90 - $140 per month, per client. (Depending on the packages you offer.)\n\nThere are downsides to every job and every profession. This one certainly has its negatives. \n\nYou'll have nightmare clients, quiet periods of the year where you're turning less profit, you may need to travel a lot and you will need to work long hours if you want to make this a living. \n\nTraining is very versatile though and you can specialise in various fields. These include, Commercial gym training, exercise referral, injury rehabilitation, lower back pain specialism, freelance training, athletic training, (so you'd train athletes like football players, boxers, professional bodybuilders, etc) and more. If you do manage to get into a field like training athletes or celebrities (like actors) you will be making some serious money if that's your overall goal. \n\nI'd say become as qualified as possible. So pick up expertise in as many areas of fitness as possible, but if you do choose personal training as your desired career path, remain as scientifically based as possible. Try not to base your prescriptions on anecdotal experience or what worked best for a certain client. Base it on science. \n\nEither way, all the best, if you have any other questions feel free to ask.",
            "Thank you very much for your response. I am not looking to make a ton of money just want to know it is a job that I wont have to do along side others to stay afloat if it were more than one person living off of the pay thats the only concern I've had over the last year but today I was talking to sales rep at one of my local gyms and he said his friend made a decent living doing personal training. I love the rewarding part of working with someone to help them improve. On the note of nutrition studies what would you need to study it as well as personal training because if I remember correctly personal training doesn't require biology or that but does nutrition",
            "https://www.publichealthdegrees.org/careers/become-registered-dietitian/\n\nHere's an article which will give you some advice on becoming a registered dietician. I am unfortunately not one so I'm not so knowledgeable on it, but I know it's better to be registered. (I am currently working towards my qualification as a dietician, but I started studying late so it's different in my case.)\n\nOn a side note, you won't touch so much on biology in personal training, but you will cover A LOT of anatomy and Physiology so you will turn into something of an expert on the human body. (I found this part of my study particularly interesting.)\n\nFreelance training, where you run your own business, is very independent so in terms of working with others this could be a potential path for you. \n\nHave a sit down and think about what it is you really want to do though man. Training is great if you go into it knowing exactly what you're doing and have a game plan for the years ahead. Just be prepared to graft when setting up your business. Building that client base when you first start is a grind, but a rewarding grind at that.",
            "This has been really helpful and informative thank you very much I will take your advice and sit and think about what I want but this seems like my main option. It looks like it's going to be a bit of work to get the qualifications but that's ok",
            "No problem mate. Yeah, you're gonna have to put some work in to be a top level, successful personal trainer, but in the end it'll be worth it. A highly qualified trainer is going to churn out some absolute beasts of human beings. \n\nAll the best my man and if you need any advice on anything, feel free to DM. I'll even refer some clients to you for digital training when you start out. (If you include digital training in your packages of course.)",
